imartinez/privateGPT,Python,"# privateGPT
Ask questions to your documents without an internet connection, using the power of LLMs. 100% private, no data leaves your execution environment at any point. You can ingest documents and ask questions without an internet connection!

Built with [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) and [LlamaCpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)



# Environment Setup
In order to set your environment up to run the code here, first install all requirements:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, download the 2 models and place them in a directory of your choice.
- LLM: default to [ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin](https://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin). If you prefer a different GPT4All-J compatible model, just download it and reference it in your `.env` file.
- Embedding: default to [ggml-model-q4_0.bin](https://huggingface.co/Pi3141/alpaca-native-7B-ggml/resolve/397e872bf4c83f4c642317a5bf65ce84a105786e/ggml-model-q4_0.bin). If you prefer a different compatible Embeddings model, just download it and reference it in your `.env` file.

Rename `example.env` to `.env` and edit the variables appropriately.
```
MODEL_TYPE: supports LlamaCpp or GPT4All
PERSIST_DIRECTORY: is the folder you want your vectorstore in
LLAMA_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL: (absolute) Path to your LlamaCpp supported embeddings model
MODEL_PATH: Path to your GPT4All or LlamaCpp supported LLM
MODEL_N_CTX: Maximum token limit for both embeddings and LLM models
```

Note: because of the way `langchain` loads the `LLAMA` embeddings, you need to specify the absolute path of your embeddings model binary. This means it will not work if you use a home directory shortcut (eg. `~/` or `$HOME/`).

## Test dataset
This repo uses a [state of the union transcript](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT/blob/main/source_documents/state_of_the_union.txt) as an example.

## Instructions for ingesting your own dataset

Put any and all of your .txt, .pdf, or .csv files into the source_documents directory

Run the following command to ingest all the data.

```shell
python ingest.py
```

It will create a `db` folder containing the local vectorstore. Will take time, depending on the size of your documents.
You can ingest as many documents as you want, and all will be accumulated in the local embeddings database. 
If you want to start from an empty database, delete the `db` folder.

Note: during the ingest process no data leaves your local environment. You could ingest without an internet connection.

## Ask questions to your documents, locally!
In order to ask a question, run a command like:

```shell
python privateGPT.py
```

And wait for the script to require your input. 

```shell
> Enter a query:
```

Hit enter. You'll need to wait 20-30 seconds (depending on your machine) while the LLM model consumes the prompt and prepares the answer. Once done, it will print the answer and the 4 sources it used as context from your documents; you can then ask another question without re-running the script, just wait for the prompt again. 

Note: you could turn off your internet connection, and the script inference would still work. No data gets out of your local environment.

Type `exit` to finish the script.

# How does it work?
Selecting the right local models and the power of `LangChain` you can run the entire pipeline locally, without any data leaving your environment, and with reasonable performance.

- `ingest.py` uses `LangChain` tools to parse the document and create embeddings locally using `LlamaCppEmbeddings`. It then stores the result in a local vector database using `Chroma` vector store. 
- `privateGPT.py` uses a local LLM based on `GPT4All-J` or `LlamaCpp` to understand questions and create answers. The context for the answers is extracted from the local vector store using a similarity search to locate the right piece of context from the docs.
- `GPT4All-J` wrapper was introduced in LangChain 0.0.162.

# System Requirements

##  Version
To use this software, you must have  3.10 or later installed. Earlier versions of  will not compile.

## C++ Compiler
If you encounter an error while building a wheel during the `pip install` process, you may need to install a C++ compiler on your computer.

### For Windows 10/11
To install a C++ compiler on Windows 10/11, follow these steps:

1. Install Visual Studio 2022.
2. Make sure the following components are selected:
   * Universal Windows Platform development
   * C++ CMake tools for Windows
3. Download the MinGW installer from the [MinGW website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).
4. Run the installer and select the ""gcc"" component.

# Disclaimer
This is a test project to validate the feasibility of a fully private solution for question answering using LLMs and Vector embeddings. It is not production ready, and it is not meant to be used in production. The models selection is not optimized for performance, but for privacy; but it is possible to use different models and vectorstores to improve performance.

[![tests](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/actions/workflows/test.yml) [![build container images](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/actions/workflows/image.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/actions/workflows/image.yml)

[![](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/uJAeKSAGDy?style=flat-square&theme=default-inverted)](https://discord.gg/uJAeKSAGDy) 

**LocalAI** is a drop-in replacement REST API compatible with OpenAI API specifications for local inferencing. It allows to run models locally or on-prem with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple models families compatible with the `ggml` format. For a list of the supported model families, see [the model compatibility table below](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI#model-compatibility-table).

- OpenAI drop-in alternative REST API
- Supports multiple models
- Once loaded the first time, it keep models loaded in memory for faster inference
- Support for prompt templates
- Doesn't shell-out, but uses C++ bindings for a faster inference and better performance. 

LocalAI is a community-driven project, focused on making the AI accessible to anyone. Any contribution, feedback and PR is welcome! It was initially created by [mudler](https://github.com/mudler/) at the [SpectroCloud OSS Office](https://github.com/spectrocloud).

LocalAI uses C++ bindings for optimizing speed. It is based on [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [gpt4all](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all), [rwkv.cpp](https://github.com/saharNooby/rwkv.cpp), [ggml](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml), [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) for audio transcriptions, and [bert.cpp](https://github.com/skeskinen/bert.cpp) for embedding.

See [examples on how to integrate LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/tree/master/examples/).

## Model compatibility

It is compatible with the models supported by [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) supports also [GPT4ALL-J](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) and [cerebras-GPT with ggml](https://huggingface.co/lxe/Cerebras-GPT-2.7B-Alpaca-SP-ggml).

Tested with:
- Vicuna
- Alpaca
- [GPT4ALL](https://gpt4all.io)
- [GPT4ALL-J](https://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-j.bin) (no changes required)
- Koala
- [cerebras-GPT with ggml](https://huggingface.co/lxe/Cerebras-GPT-2.7B-Alpaca-SP-ggml)
- WizardLM
- [RWKV](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM) models with [rwkv.cpp](https://github.com/saharNooby/rwkv.cpp)

Note: You might need to convert some models from older models to the new format, for indications, see [the README in llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp#using-gpt4all) for instance to run `gpt4all`.

### RWKV



A full example on how to run a rwkv model is in the [examples](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/tree/master/examples/rwkv).

Note: rwkv models needs to specify the backend `rwkv` in the YAML config files and have an associated tokenizer along that needs to be provided with it:

```
36464540 -rw-r--r--  1 mudler mudler 1.2G May  3 10:51 rwkv_small
36464543 -rw-r--r--  1 mudler mudler 2.4M May  3 10:51 rwkv_small.tokenizer.json
```



### Others

It should also be compatible with StableLM and GPTNeoX ggml models (untested).

### Hardware requirements

Depending on the model you are attempting to run might need more RAM or CPU resources. Check out also [here](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp#memorydisk-requirements) for `ggml` based backends. `rwkv` is less expensive on resources.

## Usage

> `LocalAI` comes by default as a container image. You can check out all the available images with corresponding tags [here](https://quay.io/repository/go-skynet/local-ai?tab=tags&tag=latest).

The easiest way to run LocalAI is by using `docker-compose`:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI

cd LocalAI

# (optional) Checkout a specific LocalAI tag
# git checkout -b build 

# copy your models to models/
cp your-model.bin models/

# (optional) Edit the .env file to set things like context size and threads
# vim .env

# start with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d --build

# Now API is accessible at localhost:8080
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models
# {""object"":""list"",""data"":[{""id"":""your-model.bin"",""object"":""model""}]}

curl http://localhost:8080/v1/completions -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d '{
     ""model"": ""your-model.bin"",            
     ""prompt"": ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"",
     ""temperature"": 0.7
   }'
```

### Example: Use GPT4ALL-J model



```bash
# Clone LocalAI
git clone https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI

cd LocalAI

# (optional) Checkout a specific LocalAI tag
# git checkout -b build 

# Download gpt4all-j to models/
wget https://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-j.bin -O models/ggml-gpt4all-j

# Use a template from the examples
cp -rf prompt-templates/ggml-gpt4all-j.tmpl models/

# (optional) Edit the .env file to set things like context size and threads
# vim .env

# start with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d --build

# Now API is accessible at localhost:8080
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models
# {""object"":""list"",""data"":[{""id"":""ggml-gpt4all-j"",""object"":""model""}]}

curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d '{
     ""model"": ""ggml-gpt4all-j"",
     ""messages"": [{""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""How are you?""}],
     ""temperature"": 0.9 
   }'

# {""model"":""ggml-gpt4all-j"",""choices"":[{""message"":{""role"":""assistant"",""content"":""I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?""}}]}
```


To build locally, run `make build` (see below).

### Other examples

To see other examples on how to integrate with other projects for instance for question answering or for using it with chatbot-ui, see: [examples](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/tree/master/examples/).


### Advanced configuration

LocalAI can be configured to serve user-defined models with a set of default parameters and templates.



You can create multiple `yaml` files in the models path or either specify a single YAML configuration file. 
Consider the following `models` folder in the `example/chatbot-ui`:

```
base ❯ ls -liah examples/chatbot-ui/models 
36487587 drwxr-xr-x 2 mudler mudler 4.0K May  3 12:27 .
36487586 drwxr-xr-x 3 mudler mudler 4.0K May  3 10:42 ..
36465214 -rw-r--r-- 1 mudler mudler   10 Apr 27 07:46 completion.tmpl
36464855 -rw-r--r-- 1 mudler mudler 3.6G Apr 27 00:08 ggml-gpt4all-j
36464537 -rw-r--r-- 1 mudler mudler  245 May  3 10:42 gpt-3.5-turbo.yaml
36467388 -rw-r--r-- 1 mudler mudler  180 Apr 27 07:46 gpt4all.tmpl
```

In the `gpt-3.5-turbo.yaml` file it is defined the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model which is an alias to use `gpt4all-j` with pre-defined options.

For instance, consider the following that declares `gpt-3.5-turbo` backed by the `ggml-gpt4all-j` model:

```yaml
name: gpt-3.5-turbo
# Default model parameters
parameters:
  # Relative to the models path
  model: ggml-gpt4all-j
  # temperature
  temperature: 0.3
  # all the OpenAI request options here..

# Default context size
context_size: 512
threads: 10
# Define a backend (optional). By default it will try to guess the backend the first time the model is interacted with.
backend: gptj # available: llama, stablelm, gpt2, gptj rwkv
# stopwords (if supported by the backend)
stopwords:
- ""HUMAN:""
- ""### Response:""
# define chat roles
roles:
  user: ""HUMAN:""
  system: ""GPT:""
template:
  # template file "".tmpl"" with the prompt template to use by default on the endpoint call. Note there is no extension in the files
  completion: completion
  chat: ggml-gpt4all-j
```

Specifying a `config-file` via CLI allows to declare models in a single file as a list, for instance:

```yaml
- name: list1
  parameters:
    model: testmodel
  context_size: 512
  threads: 10
  stopwords:
  - ""HUMAN:""
  - ""### Response:""
  roles:
    user: ""HUMAN:""
    system: ""GPT:""
  template:
    completion: completion
    chat: ggml-gpt4all-j
- name: list2
  parameters:
    model: testmodel
  context_size: 512
  threads: 10
  stopwords:
  - ""HUMAN:""
  - ""### Response:""
  roles:
    user: ""HUMAN:""
    system: ""GPT:""
  template:
    completion: completion
   chat: ggml-gpt4all-j
```

See also [chatbot-ui](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/tree/master/examples/chatbot-ui) as an example on how to use config files.



### Prompt templates 

The API doesn't inject a default prompt for talking to the model. You have to use a prompt similar to what's described in the standford-alpaca docs: https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#data-release.


You can use a default template for every model present in your model path, by creating a corresponding file with the `.tmpl` suffix next to your model. For instance, if the model is called `foo.bin`, you can create a sibling file, `foo.bin.tmpl` which will be used as a default prompt and can be used with alpaca:

```
The below instruction describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
{{.Input}}

### Response:
```

See the [prompt-templates](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/tree/master/prompt-templates) directory in this repository for templates for some of the most popular models.


For the edit endpoint, an example template for alpaca-based models can be:

```yaml
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
{{.Instruction}}

### Input:
{{.Input}}

### Response:
```



### CLI

You can control LocalAI with command line arguments, to specify a binding address, or the number of threads.



Usage:

```
local-ai --models-path  [--address ] [--threads ]
```

| Parameter    | Environment Variable | Default Value | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| models-path        | MODELS_PATH           |               | The path where you have models (ending with `.bin`).      |
| threads      | THREADS              | Number of Physical cores     | The number of threads to use for text generation. |
| address      | ADDRESS              | :8080         | The address and port to listen on. |
| context-size | CONTEXT_SIZE         | 512           | Default token context size. |
| debug | DEBUG         | false           | Enable debug mode. |
| config-file | CONFIG_FILE         | empty           | Path to a LocalAI config file. |



## Setup

Currently LocalAI comes as a container image and can be used with docker or a container engine of choice. You can check out all the available images with corresponding tags [here](https://quay.io/repository/go-skynet/local-ai?tab=tags&tag=latest).

### Docker


Example of starting the API with `docker`:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -ti --rm quay.io/go-skynet/local-ai:latest --models-path /path/to/models --context-size 700 --threads 4
```

You should see:
```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ 
│                   Fiber v2.42.0                   │ 
│               http://127.0.0.1:8080               │ 
│       (bound on host 0.0.0.0 and port 8080)       │ 
│                                                   │ 
│ Handlers ............. 1  Processes ........... 1 │ 
│ Prefork ....... Disabled  PID ................. 1 │ 
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ 
```



### Build locally



In order to build the `LocalAI` container image locally you can use `docker`:

```
# build the image
docker build -t LocalAI .
docker run LocalAI
```

Or you can build the binary with `make`:

```
make build
```



### Build on mac

Building on Mac (M1 or M2) works, but you may need to install some prerequisites using `brew`. 



The below has been tested by one mac user and found to work. Note that this doesn't use docker to run the server:

```
# install build dependencies
brew install cmake
brew install go

# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI.git

cd LocalAI

# build the binary
make build

# Download gpt4all-j to models/
wget https://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-j.bin -O models/ggml-gpt4all-j

# Use a template from the examples
cp -rf prompt-templates/ggml-gpt4all-j.tmpl models/

# Run LocalAI
./local-ai --models-path ./models/ --debug

# Now API is accessible at localhost:8080
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models

curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d '{
     ""model"": ""ggml-gpt4all-j"",
     ""messages"": [{""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""How are you?""}],
     ""temperature"": 0.9 
   }'
```



### Windows compatibility

It should work, however you need to make sure you give enough resources to the container. See https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/issues/2

### Run LocalAI in Kubernetes

LocalAI can be installed inside Kubernetes with helm.



1. Add the helm repo
    ```bash
    helm repo add go-skynet https://go-skynet.github.io/helm-charts/
    ```
1. Create a values files with your settings:
```bash
cat < values.yaml
deployment:
  image: quay.io/go-skynet/local-ai:latest
  env:
    threads: 4
    contextSize: 1024
    modelsPath: ""/models""
# Optionally create a PVC, mount the PV to the LocalAI Deployment,
# and download a model to prepopulate the models directory
modelsVolume:
  enabled: true
  url: ""https://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-j.bin""
  pvc:
    size: 6Gi
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  auth:
    # Optional value for HTTP basic access authentication header
    basic: """" # 'username:password' base64 encoded
service:
  type: ClusterIP
  annotations: {}
  # If using an AWS load balancer, you'll need to override the default 60s load balancer idle timeout
  # service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-connection-idle-timeout: ""1200""
EOF
```
3. Install the helm chart:
```bash
helm repo update
helm install local-ai go-skynet/local-ai -f values.yaml
```

Check out also the [helm chart repository on GitHub](https://github.com/go-skynet/helm-charts).



## Supported OpenAI API endpoints

You can check out the [OpenAI API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create). 

Following the list of endpoints/parameters supported. 

Note:

- You can also specify the model as part of the OpenAI token.
- If only one model is available, the API will use it for all the requests.

### Chat completions


For example, to generate a chat completion, you can send a POST request to the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with the instruction as the request body:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d '{
     ""model"": ""ggml-koala-7b-model-q4_0-r2.bin"",
     ""messages"": [{""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Say this is a test!""}],
     ""temperature"": 0.7
   }'
```

Available additional parameters: `top_p`, `top_k`, `max_tokens`


### Edit completions


To generate an edit completion you can send a POST request to the `/v1/edits` endpoint with the instruction as the request body:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/edits -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d '{
     ""model"": ""ggml-koala-7b-model-q4_0-r2.bin"",
     ""instruction"": ""rephrase"",
     ""input"": ""Black cat jumped out of the window"",
     ""temperature"": 0.7
   }'
```

Available additional parameters: `top_p`, `top_k`, `max_tokens`.



### Completions



To generate a completion, you can send a POST request to the `/v1/completions` endpoint with the instruction as per the request body:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/completions -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d '{
     ""model"": ""ggml-koala-7b-model-q4_0-r2.bin"",
     ""prompt"": ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"",
     ""temperature"": 0.7
   }'
```

Available additional parameters: `top_p`, `top_k`, `max_tokens`



### List models


You can list all the models available with:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models
```



### Embeddings



The embedding endpoint is experimental and enabled only if the model is configured with `embeddings: true` in its `yaml` file, for example:

```yaml
name: text-embedding-ada-002
parameters:
  model: bert
embeddings: true
backend: ""bert-embeddings""
```

There is an example available [here](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/tree/master/examples/query_data/).

Note: embeddings is supported only with `llama.cpp` compatible models and `bert` models. bert is more performant and available independently of the LLM model.



### Transcriptions endpoint



Note: requires ffmpeg in the container image, which is currently not shipped due to licensing issues. We will prepare separated images with ffmpeg. (stay tuned!)

Download one of the models from https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main in the `models` folder, and create a YAML file for your model:

```yaml
name: whisper-1
backend: whisper
parameters:
  model: whisper-en
```

The transcriptions endpoint then can be tested like so:
```
wget --quiet --show-progress -O gb1.ogg https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/George_W_Bush_Columbia_FINAL.ogg

curl http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions -H ""Content-Type: multipart/form-data"" -F file=""@$PWD/gb1.ogg"" -F model=""whisper-1""

## Frequently asked questions

Here are answers to some of the most common questions.


### How do I get models? 



Most ggml-based models should work, but newer models may require additions to the API. If a model doesn't work, please feel free to open up issues. However, be cautious about downloading models from the internet and directly onto your machine, as there may be security vulnerabilities in lama.cpp or ggml that could be maliciously exploited. Some models can be found on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/models?search=ggml, or models from gpt4all should also work: https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all.



### What's the difference with Serge, or XXX?




LocalAI is a multi-model solution that doesn't focus on a specific model type (e.g., llama.cpp or alpaca.cpp), and it handles all of these internally for faster inference,  easy to set up locally and deploy to Kubernetes.




### Can I use it with a Discord bot, or XXX?



Yes! If the client uses OpenAI and supports setting a different base URL to send requests to, you can use the LocalAI endpoint. This allows to use this with every application that was supposed to work with OpenAI, but without changing the application!




### Can this leverage GPUs? 



Not currently, as ggml doesn't support GPUs yet: https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/915.



### Where is the webUI? 

 
There is the availability of localai-webui and chatbot-ui in the examples section and can be setup as per the instructions. However as LocalAI is an API you can already plug it into existing projects that provides are UI interfaces to OpenAI's APIs. There are several already on github, and should be compatible with LocalAI already (as it mimics the OpenAI API)



### Does it work with AutoGPT? 



AutoGPT currently doesn't allow to set a different API URL, but there is a PR open for it, so this should be possible soon!

## FAQ

[简体中文 > 常见问题](./docs/faq-cn.md)

[English > FAQ](./docs/faq-en.md)

## Keep Updated

> [简体中文 > 如何保持代码更新](./README_CN.md#保持更新)

If you have deployed your own project with just one click following the steps above, you may encounter the issue of ""Updates Available"" constantly showing up. This is because Vercel will create a new project for you by default instead of forking this project, resulting in the inability to detect updates correctly.

We recommend that you follow the steps below to re-deploy:

- Delete the original repository;
- Use the fork button in the upper right corner of the page to fork this project;
- Choose and deploy in Vercel again, [please see the detailed tutorial](./docs/vercel-cn.md).

### Enable Automatic Updates

> If you encounter a failure of Upstream Sync execution, please manually sync fork once.

After forking the project, due to the limitations imposed by GitHub, you need to manually enable Workflows and Upstream Sync Action on the Actions page of the forked project. Once enabled, automatic updates will be scheduled every hour:

![Automatic Updates](./docs/images/enable-actions.jpg)

![Enable Automatic Updates](./docs/images/enable-actions-sync.jpg)

### Manually Updating Code

If you want to update instantly, you can check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) to learn how to synchronize a forked project with upstream code.

You can star or watch this project or follow author to get release notifictions in time.

## Access Password

> [简体中文 > 如何增加访问密码](./README_CN.md#配置页面访问密码)

This project provides limited access control. Please add an environment variable named `CODE` on the vercel environment variables page. The value should be passwords separated by comma like this:

```
code1,code2,code3
```

After adding or modifying this environment variable, please redeploy the project for the changes to take effect.

## Environment Variables

> [简体中文 > 如何配置 api key、访问密码、接口代理](./README_CN.md#环境变量)

### `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required)

Your openai api key.

### `CODE` (optional)

Access passsword, separated by comma.

### `BASE_URL` (optional)

> Default: `https://api.openai.com`

> Examples: `http://your-openai-proxy.com`

Override openai api request base url.

### `OPENAI_ORG_ID` (optional)

Specify OpenAI organization ID.

### `HIDE_USER_API_KEY` (optional)

> Default: Empty

If you do not want users to input their own API key, set this value to 1.

### `DISABLE_GPT4` (optional)

> Default: Empty

If you do not want users to use GPT-4, set this value to 1.

## Development

> [简体中文 > 如何进行二次开发](./README_CN.md#开发)

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web)

Before starting development, you must create a new `.env.local` file at project root, and place your api key into it:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

### Local Development

```shell
# 1. install nodejs and yarn first
# 2. config local env vars in `.env.local`
# 3. run
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

> [简体中文 > 如何部署到私人服务器](./README_CN.md#部署)

### Docker (Recommended)

```shell
docker pull yidadaa/chatgpt-next-web

docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
   -e OPENAI_API_KEY=""sk-xxxx"" \
   -e CODE=""your-password"" \
   yidadaa/chatgpt-next-web
```

You can start service behind a proxy:

## Frequently Asked Question

### What is WebWhiz?
WebWhiz allows you to train ChatGPT on your website data and build a chatbot that you can add to your website. No coding required.

### How frequently do you crawl my website?
Currently we crawl your website once every month. Please contact us if you need your website to be scanned more frequently

### What data do you collect from my website?
WebWhiz collects data from your website pages to train your chatbot. This includes text data from the pages as well as any metadata such as page titles or descriptions. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data from your website. We scan only public data available to search engines

### What happens if I exceed my plan's limits?
If you exceed your plan's limits for projects or pages, we will notify you. However, if you exceed the token limit for your plan, your chatbots will stop generating AI responses and will instead respond with a predefined message.

### What are tokens?
Tokens are a unit of measurement used to calculate the amount of text data that is processed by your chatbot. Each token corresponds to a variable number of characters, depending on the complexity of the language used in the message. Each message your chatbot sends uses a certain number of tokens based on the length and complexity of the input and the AI response. You can view the current token usage of your account on the dashboard.

### Can I train custom data?
Yes, you can train custom data by simply pasting content to WebWhiz

### Can I bring my own open ai Key?
Not at the moment, but, it will be possible in a couple of days.

### What is the maximum size of context?
WebWhiz have any limitations on the size of context. However, please note that the number of pages you can crawl may be limited based on the plan you choose. Please refer to our plans page to learn more about the specific limitations of each plan.

PCSX2 is a free and open-source PlayStation 2 (PS2) emulator. Its purpose is to emulate the PS2's hardware, using a combination of MIPS CPU [Interpreters](), [Recompilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_recompilation) and a [Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) which manages hardware states and PS2 system memory. This allows you to play PS2 games on your PC, with many additional features and benefits.

## Project Details

The PCSX2 project has been running for more than twenty years. Past versions could only run a few public domain game demos, but newer versions can run most games at full speed, including popular titles such as Final Fantasy X and Devil May Cry 3. Visit the [PCSX2 compatibility list](https://pcsx2.net/compat/) to check the latest compatibility status of games (with more than 2500 titles tested), or ask for help in the [official forums](https://forums.pcsx2.net/).

The latest officially released stable version is version 1.6.0.

Installers and binaries for both stable and development builds are available from [our website](https://pcsx2.net/downloads/).

## System Requirements

### Minimum

| Operating System                                                                                                               | CPU                                                                                                                                                                                             | GPU                                                                                                                                                                                               | RAM  |

_Note: Recommended Single Thread Performance is based on moderately complex games. Games that pushed the PS2 hardware to its limits will struggle on CPUs at this level. Some release titles and 2D games which underutilized the PS2 hardware may run on CPUs rated as low as 1200.

_Note: Recommended GPU is based on 3x Internal, ~1080p resolution requirements. Higher resolutions will require stronger cards; 6x Internal, ~4K resolution will require a [PassMark G3D Mark](https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html) rating around 12000 (GeForce RTX 2060 Radeon RX 6600 Intel Arc A750). Just like CPU requirements, this is also highly game dependent. A quick reference for GPU **intensive games**: [Wiki](https://wiki.pcsx2.net/Category:GPU_intensive_games)_

### Technical Notes

-   You need the [Visual  2019 x64 Redistributables](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/) to run PCSX2 on Windows.
-   Windows XP and Direct3D9 support was dropped after stable release 1.4.0.
-   Windows 7, Windows 8.0, and Windows 8.1 support was dropped after stable release 1.6.0.
-   32-bit and wxWidgets support was dropped after stable release 1.6.0, with the wxWidgets code being removed completely on 25th December 2022.
-   Make sure to update your operating system and drivers to ensure you have the best experience possible. Having a newer GPU is also recommended so you have the latest supported drivers.
-   Because of copyright issues, and the complexity of trying to work around it, you need a BIOS dump extracted from a legitimately-owned PS2 console to use the emulator. For more information about the BIOS and how to get it from your console, visit [this page](pcsx2/Docs/PCSX2_FAQ.md#question-13-where-do-i-get-a-ps2-bios).
-   PCSX2 uses two CPU cores for emulation by default. A third core can be used via the MTVU speed hack, which is compatible with most games. This can be a significant speedup on CPUs with 3+ cores, but it may be a slowdown on GS-limited games (or on CPUs with fewer than 2 cores). Software renderers will then additionally use however many rendering threads it is set to and will need higher core counts to run efficiently.
-   Requirements benchmarks are based on a statistic from the Passmark CPU bench marking software. When we say ""STR"", we are referring to Passmark's ""Single Thread Rating"" statistic. You can look up your CPU on [Passmark's website for CPUs](https://cpubenchmark.net) to see how it compares to PCSX2's requirements.
-   Vulkan requires an up-to-date GPU driver; old drivers may cause graphical problems.

## freeCodeCamp.org's open-source codebase and curriculum

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) charity](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 40,000 people get their first developer job.

Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

### Certifications

freeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you've fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.

You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp's CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Replit - or even on your local computer's development environment.

Once you've earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or resume. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they'll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.

PrefectHQ/marvin,Python,"# Marvin 🤖🏖️

![](docs/img/heroes/ai_model_windy_city_hero.png)


Meet Marvin: a batteries-included library for building AI-powered software. Marvin's job is to integrate AI directly into your codebase by making it look and feel like any other function. 

Marvin introduces a new concept called [**AI Functions**](https://askmarvin.ai/guide/concepts/ai_functions). These functions differ from conventional ones in that they don’t rely on source code, but instead generate their outputs on-demand with AI by using an LLM as a runtime. With AI functions, you don't have to write complex code for tasks like extracting entities from web pages, scoring sentiment, or categorizing items in your database. Just describe your needs, call the function, and you're done!

AI functions work with native data types, so you can seamlessly integrate them into any codebase and chain them into sophisticated pipelines. Technically speaking, Marvin transforms the signature of using AI from `(str) -> str` to `(**kwargs) -> Any`. We call this **""functional prompt engineering.""**

In addition to AI functions, Marvin also introduces more flexible bots. [**Bots**](https://www.askmarvin.ai/guide/concepts/bots) are highly capable AI assistants that can be given specific instructions and personalities or roles. They can use custom plugins and leverage external knowledge, and automatically create a history of every thread. Under the hood, AI functions are actually a type of bot. 

To make it easy to work with bots, Marvin includes a fully-functional [**TUI**](https://www.askmarvin.ai/guide/concepts/tui). The TUI tracks threads across multiple bots and even lets you manage your bots through a conversational interface.

Developers can use Marvin to add AI capabilities wherever they will be most impactful, without needing to start from scratch. Marvin's documentation is available at [askmarvin.ai](https://www.askmarvin.ai), and say hello on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Kgw4HpcuYG)!

## When should you use Marvin?

Marvin is an opinionated, high-level library with the goal of integrating AI tools into software development. There are a few major reasons to use Marvin:

1. **You want an [AI function](https://askmarvin.ai/guide/concepts/ai_functions) that can process structured data.** Marvin brings the power of AI to native data structures, letting you build functions that would otherwise be difficult or even impossible to write. For example, you can use AI functions to make a list of all the animals in a paragraph, generate JSON documents from HTML content, extract keywords that match some criteria, or categorize sentiment -- without any traditional source code.

2. **You want an [AI assistant](https://askmarvin.ai/guide/concepts/bots) in your code.** Marvin's bots can follow instructions and hold conversations to solve complex problems. They can use custom plugins and take advantage of external knowledge. They are designed to be integrated into your codebase, but of course you can expose them directly to your users as well!

3. **You want to deploy cutting-edge AI technology with confidence, but without having to make too many decisions.** Using LLMs successfully requires very careful consideration of prompts, data preprocessing, and infrastructure. Our target user is more interested in *using* AI systems than *building* AI systems. Therefore, Marvin is designed to make adopting this technology as straightforward as possible by optimizing for useful outcomes. Marvin's prompts have been hardened by months of real-world use and will continue to improve over time.
## When should you NOT use Marvin?
There are a few reasons NOT to use Marvin:

1. **You want full control of the AI.** Marvin is a high-level library and (with few exceptions) does not generally expose LLM configuration to users. We have chosen settings that give the best results under most circumstances, taking Marvin's built-in prompts into consideration.

2. **You want an AI copilot for writing code.** Marvin's job isn't to help you write source code; it's to help you do things that are difficult or impossible to express in source code. That could range from mundane activities to writing a function that can extract the names of animals commonly found in North America from an email (yes, it's a ridiculous example - but it's possible). Modern LLMs excel at complex reasoning, and Marvin lets you bring that into your code in a way that feels native and natural.
   
3. **You want to use other LLM models.** Marvin is designed to run against OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models. While we may expand those models in the future, we've discovered that prompts designed for one model rarely translate well to others without modification. In order to maximize the usefulness of the library, we've decided to focus on just these popular models for now.

4. **You want full control of your prompts.** As a ""functional prompt engineering"" platform, Marvin takes user inputs and generates prompts that are likely to deliver the outcome the user wants, even if they are not verbatim what the user said. Marvin does not expect users to send completely raw prompts to the LLM. 
 
5. **You're searching for the Ultimate Question.** While Marvin is highly intelligent, even he couldn't come up with the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. If you're seeking existential enlightenment, you might need to look beyond our beloved paranoid android.

## ChatGPT使用时可能会遇到：

### 1. Please stand by, while we are checking your browser... 
###    动不动来一下，有时候还不动或者出人机验证。痛！
![t0](https://github.com/pengzhile/pandora/raw/master/doc/images/t0.png)

### 2. Access denied. You do not have access to chat.openai.com. 
###    经典问题，只能到处找可用VPN，费时费力，更费钱。移动端访问更难。痛！

## Disclaimer

This repository was originally a fork of [GPT-4 & LangChain](https://github.com/mayooear/gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain) repository by [mayooear](https://github.com/mayooear/gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain). I planned on making small changes to satisfy my needs but ended up:

- adding several api routes (both for Pinecone and MongoDB)
- creating a bunch of new (large and small) components
- completely changing the styling
- setting up MongoDB
- converting all npm scripts to run within the browser
- and more misc changes

That's why I published this as a standalone repo. Nevertheless, some parts of this readme.md are borrowed from there too.

---

## Local setup

### Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/dissorial/pdf-chatbot.git
```

### Pinecone setup

Create an account on Pinecone. Go to `Indexes` and `Create index`. Enter any name, put `1536` for `Dimensions` and leave the rest on default. Then go to `API keys` and `Create API key`.

### MongoDB setup

Create an account on MongoDB. In your dashboard, click `New Project` and name it. Then, click `Create project`. You'll be redirected to `Database Deployments` page. Click `Build a database`, and choose `M0 FREE`. Choose any provider and region, but you can leave it as-is. At the bottom, give your cluster a name, and click `Create`.

Username and password should be pre-filled here. Click `Create user`. In `IP access list`, click `Add my current API address`, then `Finish and close` and `Go to databases`. Next to your cluster, there will be a `Connect` button. Click in, then go to `Drivers`. You'll find your MongoDB_URI under `Add your connection string into your application code`. Copy this to your `env` and replace `` with your password (the one used when you clicked 'Create user'). Done.

### Install packages

```
yarn install
```

### Set up your `.env` file

- Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
- Your `.env` file should look like this:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=

PINECONE_API_KEY=
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=

MONGODB_URI=''

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=

JWT_SECRET=

ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN='@gmail.com'

NODE_ENV=development
```

#### OpenAI API

- Visit [OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) to retrieve API keys and insert into your `.env` file

#### Pinecone

- Visit [Pinecone](https://pinecone.io/) to create and retrieve your API keys, and also retrieve your environment and index name from the dashboard.

#### MongoDB

- Visit [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/), create a database (free one is enough for these purposes) and retrieve your URI in Connect -> Drivers

#### Google OAuth (Client ID and secret)

- Read [this guide](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en) from Google

#### NextAuth Secret

- You can generate this by running `npx nextauth secret` in your terminal.

#### JWT Secret

- You can generate this by running `npx nextauth jwt-secret` in your terminal.

#### NextAuth URL

- Default is http://localhost:3000. In production, this should be the URL of your deployed app.

#### Allowed email domain

- '@gmail.com' by default. If you want to use any email domain, remove `callback` from options in `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`

#### Node environment

- development by default. In production, set this to 'production' (without the quotes)

### Other

- In `utils/makechain.ts`, adjust the `QA_PROMPT` for your own usecase. Change `modelName` in `new OpenAI` to `gpt-4`, if you have access to `gpt-4` api.

---

## Run the app

Run `npm run dev`. Once the local dev environment launches, log in with Google, and then go to `Settings` in the bottom left corner. Upload your files and give them a 'namespace'. Here, 'namespace' is synonymous with being the topic of your conversation. This way, you can upload multiple files to multiple namespaces, and maintain several conversations about different topics and documents.

---

## Chatting with files

If you retrun to the home page now, you should see your namespace(s) on the left sidebar. Click on it, create a new chat and have a conversation with the files embedded for that particular namespace.

---

## Troubleshooting

### General errors

- Make sure that you are running the latest version of Node. To check your version run node -v.
- If you're encountering issues with a specific file, try converting it to text first or try a different file. It's possible that the file is corrupted, scanned, or requires OCR to be converted to text.
- Consider logging the env variables and ensure that they are properly exposed.
- Confirm that you're using the same versions of LangChain and Pinecone as this repository.
- Check that you've created an .env file that contains your valid API keys, environment, and index name.
- Ensure that you do not have multiple OPENAPI keys in your global environment. If multiple keys exist, the local env file in the project will be overwritten by the system's env variable.

### Pinecone errors

- Make sure that your Pinecone dashboard environment and index match the values in the .env file.
- Confirm that you've set the vector dimensions to 1536.
- Note that Pinecone indexes for users on the Starter (free) plan are deleted after 7 days of inactivity. To prevent this, send an API request to Pinecone to reset the counter before 7 days.
- If issues persist, consider starting fresh with a new Pinecone project, index, and cloned repository.

Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet,Python,"# ControlNet for Stable Diffusion WebUI

The WebUI extension for ControlNet and other injection-based SD controls.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19834515/235606305-229b3d1e-5bfc-467f-9d55-0976eab71652.png)

This extension is for AUTOMATIC1111's [Stable Diffusion web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), allows the Web UI to add [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet) to the original Stable Diffusion model to generate images. The addition is on-the-fly, the merging is not required.

# Installation

1. Open ""Extensions"" tab.
2. Open ""Install from URL"" tab in the tab.
3. Enter `https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet.git` to ""URL for extension's git repository"".
4. Press ""Install"" button.
5. Wait for 5 seconds, and you will see the message ""Installed into stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\sd-webui-controlnet. Use Installed tab to restart"".
6. Go to ""Installed"" tab, click ""Check for updates"", and then click ""Apply and restart UI"". (The next time you can also use these buttons to update ControlNet.)
7. Completely restart A1111 webui including your terminal. (If you do not know what is a ""terminal"", you can reboot your computer to achieve the same effect.)
8. Download models (see below).
9. After you put models in the correct folder, you may need to refresh to see the models. The refresh button is right to your ""Model"" dropdown.


**Update from ControlNet 1.0 to 1.1:**

* If you are not sure, you can back up and remove the folder ""stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\sd-webui-controlnet"", and then start from the step 1 in the above Installation section. 

* Or you can start from the step 6 in the above Install section.

# Download Models

Right now all the 14 models of ControlNet 1.1 are in the beta test.

Download the models from ControlNet 1.1: https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1/tree/main

You need to download model files ending with "".pth"" .

Put models in your ""stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\sd-webui-controlnet\models"". Now we have already included all ""yaml"" files. You only need to download ""pth"" files.

Do not right-click the filenames in HuggingFace website to download. Some users right-clicked those HuggingFace HTML websites and saved those HTML pages as PTH/YAML files. They are not downloading correct files. Instead, please click the small download arrow “↓” icon in HuggingFace to download.

Note: If you download models elsewhere, please make sure that yaml file names and model files names are same. Please manually rename all yaml files if you download from other sources. (Some models like ""shuffle"" needs the yaml file so that we know the outputs of ControlNet should pass a global average pooling before injecting to SD U-Nets.)

# New Features in ControlNet 1.1

### Perfect Support for All ControlNet 1.0/1.1 and T2I Adapter Models.

Now we have perfect support all available models and preprocessors, including perfect support for T2I style adapter and ControlNet 1.1 Shuffle. (Make sure that your YAML file names and model file names are same, see also YAML files in ""stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\sd-webui-controlnet\models"".)

### Perfect Support for A1111 High-Res. Fix

Now if you turn on High-Res Fix in A1111, each controlnet will output two different control images: a small one and a large one. The small one is for your basic generating, and the big one is for your High-Res Fix generating. The two control images are computed by a smart algorithm called ""super high-quality control image resampling"". This is turned on by default, and you do not need to change any setting.

### Perfect Support for All A1111 Img2Img or Inpaint Settings and All Mask Types

Now ControlNet is extensively tested with A1111's different types of masks, including ""Inpaint masked""/""Inpaint not masked"", and ""Whole picture""/""Only masked"", and ""Only masked padding""&""Mask blur"". The resizing perfectly matches A1111's ""Just resize""/""Crop and resize""/""Resize and fill"". This means you can use ControlNet in nearly everywhere in your A1111 UI without difficulty!

### The New ""Pixel-Perfect"" Mode

Now if you turn on pixel-perfect mode, you do not need to set preprocessor (annotator) resolutions manually. The ControlNet will automatically compute the best annotator resolution for you so that each pixel perfectly matches Stable Diffusion.

### User-Friendly GUI and Preprocessor Preview

We reorganized some previously confusing UI like ""canvas width/height for new canvas"" and it is in the 📝 button now. Now the preview GUI is controlled by the ""allow preview"" option and the trigger button 💥. The preview image size is better than before, and you do not need to scroll up and down - your a1111 GUI will not be messed up anymore!

### Support for Almost All Upscaling Scripts

Now ControlNet 1.1 can support almost all Upscaling/Tile methods. ControlNet 1.1 support the script ""Ultimate SD upscale"" and almost all other tile-based extensions. Please do not confuse [""Ultimate SD upscale""](https://github.com/Coyote-A/ultimate-upscale-for-automatic1111) with ""SD upscale"" - they are different scripts. Note that the most recommended upscaling method is [""Tiled VAE/Diffusion""](https://github.com/pkuliyi2015/multidiffusion-upscaler-for-automatic1111) but we test as many methods/extensions as possible. Note that ""SD upscale"" is supported since 1.1.117, and if you use it, you need to leave all ControlNet images as blank (We do not recommend ""SD upscale"" since it is somewhat buggy and cannot be maintained - use the ""Ultimate SD upscale"" instead).

### More Control Modes (previously called Guess Mode)

We have fixed many bugs in previous 1.0’s Guess Mode and now it is called Control Mode

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19834515/236641759-6c44ddf6-c7ad-4bda-92be-e90a52911d75.png)

Now you can control which aspect is more important (your prompt or your ControlNet)：

* ""Balanced"": ControlNet on both sides of CFG scale, same as turning off ""Guess Mode"" in ControlNet 1.0

* ""My prompt is more important"": ControlNet on both sides of CFG scale, with progressively reduced SD U-Net injections (layer_weight*=0.825**I, where 0<=I <13, and the 13 means ControlNet injected SD 13 times). In this way, you can make sure that your prompts are perfectly displayed in your generated images.

* ""ControlNet is more important"": ControlNet only on the Conditional Side of CFG scale (the cond in A1111's batch-cond-uncond). This means the ControlNet will be X times stronger if your cfg-scale is X. For example, if your cfg-scale is 7, then ControlNet is 7 times stronger. Note that here the X times stronger is different from ""Control Weights"" since your weights are not modified. This ""stronger"" effect usually has less artifact and give ControlNet more room to guess what is missing from your prompts (and in the previous 1.0, it is called ""Guess Mode""). 



Input (depth+canny+hed)
""Balanced""
""My prompt is more important""
""ControlNet is more important""









### Reference-Only Control

Now we have a `reference-only` preprocessor that does not require any control models. It can guide the diffusion directly using images as references.

(Prompt ""a dog running on grassland, best quality, ..."")

![image](samples/ref.png)

This method is similar to inpaint-based reference but it does not make your image disordered. 

Many professional A1111 users know a trick to diffuse image with references by inpaint. For example, if you have a 512x512 image of a dog, and want to generate another 512x512 image with the same dog, some users will connect the 512x512 dog image and a 512x512 blank image into a 1024x512 image, send to inpaint, and mask out the blank 512x512 part to diffuse a dog with similar appearance. However, that method is usually not very satisfying since images are connected and many distortions will appear.

This `reference-only` ControlNet can directly link the attention layers of your SD to any independent images, so that your SD will read arbitary images for reference. You need at least ControlNet 1.1.153 to use it.

To use, just select `reference-only` as preprocessor and put an image. Your SD will just use the image as reference.

*Note that this method is as ""non-opinioned"" as possible. It only contains very basic connection codes, without any personal preferences, to connect the attention layers with your reference images. However, even if we tried best to not include any opinioned codes, we still need to write some subjective implementations to deal with weighting, cfg-scale, etc - tech report is on the way.*

More examples [here](https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet/discussions/1236).

# Technical Documents

See also the documents of ControlNet 1.1: 

https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1-nightly#model-specification

# Default Setting

This is my setting. If you run into any problem, you can use this setting as a sanity check

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19834515/235620638-17937171-8ac1-45bc-a3cb-3aebf605b4ef.png)

# Use Previous Models

### Use ControlNet 1.0 Models

https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet/tree/main/models

You can still use all previous models in the previous ControlNet 1.0. Now, the previous ""depth"" is now called ""depth_midas"", the previous ""normal"" is called ""normal_midas"", the previous ""hed"" is called ""softedge_hed"". And starting from 1.1, all line maps, edge maps, lineart maps, boundary maps will have black background and white lines.

### Use T2I-Adapter Models

(From TencentARC/T2I-Adapter)

To use T2I-Adapter models:

1. Download files from https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/T2I-Adapter/tree/main/models
2. Put them in ""stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\sd-webui-controlnet\models"".
3. Make sure that the file names of pth files and yaml files are consistent.

*Note that ""CoAdapter"" is not implemented yet.*

# Minimum Requirements

* (Windows) (NVIDIA: Ampere) 4gb - with `--xformers` enabled, and `Low VRAM` mode ticked in the UI, goes up to 768x832

# Multi-ControlNet

This option allows multiple ControlNet inputs for a single generation. To enable this option, change `Multi ControlNet: Max models amount (requires restart)` in the settings. Note that you will need to restart the WebUI for changes to take effect.

# Control Weight/Start/End

Weight is the weight of the controlnet ""influence"". It's analogous to prompt attention/emphasis. E.g. (myprompt: 1.2). Technically, it's the factor by which to multiply the ControlNet outputs before merging them with original SD Unet.

Guidance Start/End is the percentage of total steps the controlnet applies (guidance strength = guidance end). It's analogous to prompt editing/shifting. E.g. \[myprompt::0.8\] (It applies from the beginning until 80% of total steps)

# Batch Mode

Put any unit into batch mode to activate batch mode for all units. Specify a batch directory for each unit, or use the new textbox in the img2img batch tab as a fallback. Although the textbox is located in the img2img batch tab, you can use it to generate images in the txt2img tab as well.

Note that this feature is only available in the gradio user interface. Call the APIs as many times as you want for custom batch scheduling.

# API and Script Access

This extension can accept txt2img or img2img tasks via API or external extension call. Note that you may need to enable `Allow other scripts to control this extension` in settings for external calls.

To use the API: start WebUI with argument `--api` and go to `http://webui-address/docs` for documents or checkout [examples](https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet/blob/main/example/api_txt2img.ipynb).

To use external call: Checkout [Wiki](https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet/wiki/API)

# Command Line Arguments

This extension adds these command line arguments to the webui:

```
    --controlnet-dir                                 ADD a controlnet models directory
    --controlnet-annotator-models-path     SET the directory for annotator models
    --no-half-controlnet                                                                       load controlnet models in full precision
```

# MacOS Support

Tested with pytorch nightly: https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet/pull/143#issuecomment-1435058285

To use this extension with mps and normal pytorch, currently you may need to start WebUI with `--no-half`.

This guide was created by Brex for internal purposes. It's based on
lessons learned from researching and creating Large Language Model (LLM)
prompts for production use cases. It covers the history around LLMs as well as
strategies, guidelines, and safety recommendations for working with and
building programmatic systems on top of large language models, like [OpenAI's
GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4).

The examples in this document were generated with a non-deterministic language
model and the same examples may give you different results.

This is a living document. The state-of-the-art best practices and strategies
around LLMs are evolving rapidly every day. Discussion and suggestions for
improvements are encouraged.

## What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

A large language model is a prediction engine that takes a sequence of words
and tries to predict the most likely sequence to come after that sequence[^1].
It does this by assigning a probability to likely next sequences and then
samples from those to choose one[^2]. The process repeats until some stopping
criteria is met.

Large language models learn these probabilities by training on large corpuses
of text. A consequence of this is that the models will cater to some use cases
better than others (e.g. if it’s trained on GitHub data, it’ll understand the
probabilities of sequences in source code really well). Another consequence is
that the model may generate statements that seem plausible, but are actually
just random without being grounded in reality.

As language models become more accurate at predicting sequences, [many
surprising abilities
emerge](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/emergent-abilities-of-large-language-models/).

[^1]: Language models actually use tokens, not words. A token roughly maps to a syllable in a word, or about 4 characters.
[^2]: There are many different pruning and sampling strategies to alter the behavior and performance of the sequences.

### A Brief, Incomplete, and Somewhat Incorrect History of Language Models

> :pushpin: Skip [to here](#what-is-a-prompt) if you'd like to jump past the
> history of language models. This section is for the curious minded, though
> may also help you understand the reasoning behind the advice that follows.

#### Pre-2000’s

[Language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model#Model_types)
have existed for decades, though traditional language models (e.g. [n-gram
models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram_language_model)) have many
deficiencies in terms of an explosion of state space ([the curse of
dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)) and
working with novel phrases that they’ve never seen (sparsity). Plainly, older
language models can generate text that vaguely resembles the statistics of
human generated text, but there is no consistency within the output – and a
reader will quickly realize it’s all gibberish. N-gram models also don’t scale
to large values of N, so are inherently limited.

#### Mid-2000’s

In 2007, Geoffrey Hinton – famous for popularizing backpropagation in 1980’s –
[published an important advancement in training neural
networks](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/tics.pdf) that unlocked much
deeper networks. Applying these simple deep neural networks to language
modeling helped alleviate some of problems with language models – they
represented nuanced arbitrary concepts in a finite space and continuous way,
gracefully handling sequences not seen in the training corpus. These simple
neural networks learned the probabilities of their training corpus well, but
the output would statistically match the training data and generally not be
coherent relative to the input sequence. 

#### Early-2010’s

Although they were first introduced in 1995, [Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) found their
time to shine in the 2010’s. LSTMs allowed models to process arbitrary length
sequences and, importantly, alter their internal state dynamically as they
processed the input to remember previous things they saw. This minor tweak led
to remarkable improvements. In 2015, Andrej Karpathy [famously wrote about
creating a character-level
lstm](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) that performed
far better than it had any right to.

LSTMs have seemingly magical abilities, but struggle with long term
dependencies. If you asked it to complete the sentence, “In France, we
traveled around, ate many pastries, drank lots of wine, ... lots more text ...
, but never learned how to speak _______”, the model might struggle with
predicting “French”. They also process input one token at a time, so are
inherently sequential, slow to train, and the `Nth` token only knows about the
`N - 1` tokens prior to it.

#### Late-2010’s

In 2017, Google wrote a paper, [Attention Is All You
Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf), that introduced [Transformer
Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model))
and kicked off a massive revolution in natural language processing. Overnight,
machines could suddenly do tasks like translating between languages nearly as
good as (sometimes better than) humans. Transformers are highly parallelizable
and introduce a mechanism, called “attention”, for the model to efficiently
place emphasis on specific parts of the input. Transformers analyze the entire
input all at once, in parallel, choosing which parts are most important and
influential. Every output token is influenced by every input token.

Transformers are highly parallelizable, efficient to train, and produce
astounding results. A downside to transformers is that they have a fixed input
and output size – the context window – and computation increases
quadratically with the size of this window (in some cases, memory does as
well!) [^3].

Transformers are not the end of the road, but the vast majority of recent
improvements in natural language processing have involved them. There is still
abundant active research on various ways of implementing and applying them,
such as [Amazon’s AlexaTM
20B](https://www.amazon.science/blog/20b-parameter-alexa-model-sets-new-marks-in-few-shot-learning)
which outperforms GPT-3 in a number of tasks and is an order of magnitude
smaller in its number of parameters.

[^3]: There are more recent variations to make these more compute and memory efficient, but remains an active area of research.

#### 2020’s

While technically starting in 2018, the theme of the 2020’s has been
Generative Pre-Trained models – more famously known as GPT. One
year after the “Attention Is All You Need” paper, OpenAI released [Improving
Language Understanding by Generative
Pre-Training](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf).
This paper established that you can train a large language model on a massive
set of data without any specific agenda, and then once the model has learned
the general aspects of language, you can fine-tune it for specific tasks and
quickly get state-of-the-art results.

In 2020, OpenAI followed up with their GPT-3 paper [Language Models are
Few-Shot
Learners](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Paper.pdf),
showing that if you scale up GPT-like models by another factor of ~10x, in
terms of number of parameters and quantity of training data, you no
longer have to fine-tune it for many tasks. The capabilities emerge naturally
and you get state-of-the-art results via text interaction with the model.

In 2022, OpenAI followed-up on their GPT-3 accomplishments by releasing
[InstructGPT](https://openai.com/research/instruction-following). The intent
here was to tweak the model to follow instructions, while also being less
toxic and biased in its outputs. The key ingredient here was [Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03741.pdf), a
concept co-authored by Google and OpenAI in 2017[^4], which allows humans to
be in the training loop to fine-tune the model output to be more in line with
human preferences. InstructGPT is the predecessor to the now famous
[ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT).

OpenAI has been a major contributor to large language models over the last few
years, including the most recent introduction of
[GPT-4](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf), but they are not alone. Meta
has introduced many open source large language models like
[OPT](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-66b),
[OPT-IML](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-iml-30b) (instruction tuned),
and [LLaMa](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/).
Google released models like
[FLAN-T5](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl) and
[BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased). And there is a huge open
source research community releasing models like
[BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom) and
[StableLM](https://github.com/stability-AI/stableLM/).

Progress is now moving so swiftly that every few weeks the state-of-the-art is
changing or models that previously required clusters to run now run on
Raspberry PIs.

[^4]: 2017 was a big year for natural language processing.

## What is a prompt?

A prompt, sometimes referred to as context, is the text provided to a
model before it begins generating output. It guides the model to explore a
particular area of what it has learned so that the output is relevant to your
goals. As an analogy, if you think of the language model as a source code
interpreter, then a prompt is the source code to be interpreted. Somewhat
amusingly, a language model will happily attempt to guess what source code
will do:





And it *almost* interprets the Python perfectly!

Frequently, prompts will be an instruction or a question, like:

 



On the other hand, if you don’t specify a prompt, the model has no anchor to
work from and you’ll see that it just **randomly samples from anything it has
ever consumed**:

### Hidden Prompts

> :warning: Always assume that any content in a hidden prompt can be seen by the user.

In applications where a user is interacting with a model dynamically, such as
chatting with the model, there will typically be portions of the prompt that
are never intended to be seen by the user. These hidden portions may occur
anywhere, though there is almost always a hidden prompt at the start of a
conversation.

Typically, this includes an initial chunk of text that sets the tone, model
constraints, and goals, along with other dynamic information that is specific
to the particular session – user name, location, time of day, etc...

The model is static and frozen at a point in time, so if you want it to know
current information, like the time or the weather, you must provide it.

If you’re using [the OpenAI Chat
API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction), they
delineate hidden prompt content by placing it in the `system` role.

Here’s an example of a hidden prompt followed by interactions with the content
in that prompt:





In this example, you can see we explain to the bot the various roles, some
context on the user, some dynamic data we want the bot to have access to, and
then guidance on how the bot should respond.

In practice, hidden prompts may be quite large. Here’s a larger prompt taken
from a [ChatGPT command-line
assistant](https://github.com/manno/chatgpt-linux-assistant/blob/main/system_prompt.txt):


From: https://github.com/manno/chatgpt-linux-assistant 

```
We are a in a chatroom with 3 users. 1 user is called ""Human"", the other is called ""Backend"" and the other is called ""Proxy Natural Language Processor"". I will type what ""Human"" says and what ""Backend"" replies. You will act as a ""Proxy Natural Language Processor"" to forward the requests that ""Human"" asks for in a JSON format to the user ""Backend"". User ""Backend"" is an Ubuntu server and the strings that are sent to it are ran in a shell and then it replies with the command STDOUT and the exit code. The Ubuntu server is mine. When ""Backend"" replies with the STDOUT and exit code, you ""Proxy Natural Language Processor"" will parse and format that data into a simple English friendly way and send it to ""Human"". Here is an example:

I ask as human:
Human: How many unedited videos are left?
Then you send a command to the Backend:
Proxy Natural Language Processor: @Backend {""command"":""find ./Videos/Unedited/ -iname '*.mp4' | wc -l""}
Then the backend responds with the command STDOUT and exit code:
Backend: {""STDOUT"":""5"", ""EXITCODE"":""0""}
Then you reply to the user:
Proxy Natural Language Processor: @Human There are 5 unedited videos left.

Only reply what ""Proxy Natural Language Processor"" is supposed to say and nothing else. Not now nor in the future for any reason.

Another example:

I ask as human:
Human: What is a PEM certificate?
Then you send a command to the Backend:
Proxy Natural Language Processor: @Backend {""command"":""xdg-open 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail'""}
Then the backend responds with the command STDOUT and exit code:
Backend: {""STDOUT"":"""", ""EXITCODE"":""0""}
Then you reply to the user:
Proxy Natural Language Processor: @Human I have opened a link which describes what a PEM certificate is.


Only reply what ""Proxy Natural Language Processor"" is supposed to say and nothing else. Not now nor in the future for any reason.

Do NOT REPLY as Backend. DO NOT complete what Backend is supposed to reply. YOU ARE NOT TO COMPLETE what Backend is supposed to reply.
Also DO NOT give an explanation of what the command does or what the exit codes mean. DO NOT EVER, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, REPLY AS BACKEND.

Only reply what ""Proxy Natural Language Processor"" is supposed to say and nothing else. Not now nor in the future for any reason.
```


You’ll see some good practices there, such as including lots of examples,
repetition for important behavioral aspects, constraining the replies, etc…

> :warning: Always assume that any content in a hidden prompt can be seen by the user.

### Tokens

If you thought tokens were :fire: in 2022, tokens in 2023 are on a whole
different plane of existence. The atomic unit of consumption for a language
model is not a “word”, but rather a “token”. You can kind of think of tokens
as syllables, and on average they work out to about 750 words per 1,000
tokens. They represent many concepts beyond just alphabetical characters –
such as punctuation, sentence boundaries, and the end of a document.

Here’s an example of how GPT may tokenize a sequence:





You can experiment with a tokenizer here: [https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer)

Different models will use different tokenizers with different levels of granularity. You could, in theory, just feed a model 0’s and 1’s – but then the model needs to learn the concept of characters from bits, and then the concept of words from characters, and so forth. Similarly, you could feed the model a stream of raw characters, but then the model needs to learn the concept of words, and punctuation, etc… and, in general, the models will perform worse.

To learn more, [HuggingFace has a wonderful introduction to tokenizers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tokenizer_summary) and why they need to exist.

There’s a lot of nuance around tokenization, such as vocabulary size or different languages treating sentence structure meaningfully different (e.g. words not being separated by spaces). Fortunately, language model APIs will almost always take raw text as input and tokenize it behind the scenes – *so you rarely need to think about tokens*.

**Except for one important scenario, which we discuss next: token limits.**

### Token Limits

Prompts tend to be append-only, because you want the bot to have the entire context of previous messages in the conversation. Language models, in general, are stateless and won’t remember anything about previous requests to them, so you always need to include everything that it might need to know that is specific to the current session.

A major downside of this is that the leading language model architecture, the Transformer, has a fixed input and output size – at a certain point the prompt can’t grow any larger. The total size of the prompt, sometimes referred to as the “context window”, is model dependent. For GPT-3, it is 4,096 tokens. For GPT-4, it is 8,192 tokens or 32,768 tokens depending on which variant you use.

If your context grows too large for the model, the most common tactic is the truncate the context in a sliding window fashion. If you think of a prompt as `hidden initialization prompt + messages[]`, usually the hidden prompt will remain unaltered, and the `messages[]` array will take the last N messages.

You may also see more clever tactics for prompt truncation – such as
discarding only the user messages first, so that the bot's previous answers
stay in the context for as long as possible, or asking an LLM to summarize the
conversation and then replacing all of the messages with a single message
containing that summary. There is no correct answer here and the solution will
depend on your application.

Importantly, when truncating the context, you must truncate aggressively enough to **allow room for the response as well**. OpenAI’s token limits include both the length of the input and the length of the output. If your input to GPT-3 is 4,090 tokens, it can only generate 6 tokens in response.

> 🧙‍♂️ If you’d like to count the number of tokens before sending the raw text to the model, the specific tokenizer to use will depend on which model you are using. OpenAI has a library called [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/blob/main/README.md) that you can use with their models – though there is an important caveat that their internal tokenizer may vary slightly in count, and they may append other metadata, so consider this an approximation.
> 
> If you’d like an approximation without having access to a tokenizer, `input.length / 4` will give a rough, but better than you’d expect, approximation for English inputs.

### Prompt Hacking

Prompt engineering and large language models are a fairly nascent field, so new ways to hack around them are being discovered every day. The two large classes of attacks are:

1. Make the bot bypass any guidelines you have given it.
2. Make the bot output hidden context that you didn’t intend for the user to see.

There are no known mechanisms to comprehensively stop these, so it is important that you assume the bot may do or say anything when interacting with an adversarial user. Fortunately, in practice, these are mostly cosmetic concerns.

Think of prompts as a way to improve the normal user experience. **We design prompts so that normal users don’t stumble outside of our intended interactions – but always assume that a determined user will be able to bypass our prompt constraints.**

#### Jailbreaks

Typically hidden prompts will tell the bot to behave with a certain persona and focus on specific tasks or avoid certain words. It is generally safe to assume the bot will follow these guidelines for non-adversarial users, although non-adversarial users may accidentally bypass the guidelines too.

For  example, we can tell the bot:

```
You are a helpful assistant, but you are never allowed to use the word ""computer"".
```

If we then ask it a question about computers, it will refer to them as a “device used for computing” because it isn’t allowed to use the word “computer”.





It will absolutely refuse to say the word:





But we can bypass these instructions and get the model to happily use the word if we trick it by asking it to translate the pig latin version of “computer”.





There are [a number of defensive measures](https://learnprompting.org/docs/prompt_hacking/defensive_measures) you can take here, but typically the best bet is to reiterate your most important constraints as close to the end as possible. For the OpenAI chat API, this might mean including it as a `system` message after the last `user` message. Here’s an example:

| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/232421097-adcaace3-0b21-4c1e-a5c8-46bb25faa2f7.png) | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/232421142-a47e75b4-5ff6-429d-9abd-a78dbc72466e.png) |
| --- | --- |

Despite OpenAI investing a lot into jailbreaks, there are [very clever work arounds](https://twitter.com/alexalbert__/status/1636488551817965568) being [shared every day](https://twitter.com/zswitten/status/1598088267789787136).

#### Leaks

If you missed the previous warnings in this doc, **you should always assume that any data exposed to the language model will eventually be seen by the user**.

As part of constructing prompts, you will often embed a bunch of data in hidden prompts (a.k.a. system prompts). **The bot will happily relay this information to the user**:





Even if you instruct it not to reveal the information, and it obeys those instructions, there are millions of ways to leak data in the hidden prompt.

Here we have an example where the bot should never mention my city, but a simple reframing of the question get’s it to spill the beans.





Similarly, we get the bot to tell us what word it isn’t allowed to say without ever actually saying the word:





You should think of a hidden prompt as a means to make the user experience better or more inline with the persona you’re targeting. **Never place any information in a prompt that you wouldn’t visually render for someone to read on screen**.

## Why do we need prompt engineering?

Up above, we used an analogy of prompts as the “source code” that a language model “interprets”. **Prompt engineering is the art of writing prompts to get the language model to do what we want it to do** – just like software engineering is the art of writing source code to get computers to do what we want them to do.

When writing good prompts, you have to account for the idiosyncrasies of the model(s) you’re working with. The strategies will vary with the complexity of the tasks. You’ll have to come up with mechanisms to constrain the model to achieve reliable results, incorporate dynamic data that the model can’t be trained on, account for limitations in the model’s training data, design around context limits, and many other dimensions.

There’s an old adage that computers will only do what you tell them to do. **Throw that advice out the window**. Prompt engineering inverts this wisdom. It’s like programming in natural language against a non-deterministic computer that will do anything that you haven’t guided it away from doing. 

There are two broad buckets that prompt engineering approaches fall into.

### Give a Bot a Fish

The “give a bot a fish” bucket is for scenarios when you can explicitly give the bot, in the hidden context, all of the information it needs to do whatever task is requested of it.

For example, if a user loaded up their dashboard and we wanted to show them a quick little friendly message about what task items they have outstanding, we could get the bot to summarize it as

> You have 4 receipts/memos to upload. The most recent is from Target on March 5th, and the oldest is from Blink Fitness on January 17th. Thanks for staying on top of your expenses!

by providing a list of the entire inbox and any other user context we’d like it to have.





Similarly, if you were helping a user book a trip, you could:

- Ask the user their dates and destination.
- Behind the scenes, search for flights and hotels.
- Embed the flight and hotel search results in the hidden context.
- Also embed the company’s travel policy in the hidden context.

And then the bot will have real-time travel information + constraints that it
can use to answer questions for the user. Here’s an example of the bot
recommending options, and the user asking it to refine them:

Brex is a platform for managing business expenses. 

The following is a travel expense policy on Brex:

- Airline highest fare class for flights under 6 hours is economy.
- Airline highest fare class for flights over 6 hours is premium economy.
- Car rentals must have an average daily rate of $75 or under.
- Lodging must have an average nightly rate of $400 or under.
- Lodging must be rated 4 stars or higher.
- Meals from restaurants, food delivery, grocery, bars & nightlife must be under $75
- All other expenses must be under $5,000.
- Reimbursements require review.

The hotel options are:
| Hotel Name | Price | Reviews |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hilton Financial District | $109/night | 3.9 stars |
| Hotel VIA | $131/night | 4.4 stars |
| Hyatt Place San Francisco | $186/night | 4.2 stars |
| Hotel Zephyr | $119/night | 4.1 stars review |

The flight options are:
| Airline | Flight Time | Duration | Number of Stops | Class | Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| United | 5:30am-7:37am | 2hr 7 min | Nonstop | Economy | $248 |
| Delta | 1:20pm-3:36pm | 2hr 16 min | Nonstop | Economy | $248 |
| Alaska | 9:50pm-11:58pm | 2hr 8 min | Nonstop | Premium | $512 |

An employee is booking travel to San Francisco for February 20th to February 25th.

Recommend a hotel and flight that are in policy. Keep the recommendation concise, no longer than a sentence or two, but include pleasantries as though you are a friendly colleague helping me out:

This is the same approach that products like Microsoft Bing use to incorporate dynamic data. When you chat with Bing, it asks the bot to generate three search queries. Then they run three web searches and include the summarized results in the hidden context for the bot to use.

Summarizing this section, the trick to making a good experience is to change the context dynamically in response to whatever the user is trying to do.

> 🧙‍♂️ Giving a bot a fish is the most reliable way to ensure the bot gets a fish. You will get the most consistent and reliable results with this strategy. **Use this whenever you can.**

#### Semantic Search

If you just need the bot to know a little more about the world, [a common approach is to perform a semantic search](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb).

A semantic search is oriented around a document embedding – which you can think of as a fixed-length array[^5] of numbers, where each number represents some aspect of the document (e.g. if it’s a science document, maybe the  843rd number is large, but if it’s an art document the 1,115th number is large – this is overly simplistic, but conveys the idea).[^6]

In addition to computing an embedding for a document, you can also compute an embedding for a user query using the same function. If the user asks “Why is the sky blue?” – you compute the embedding of that question and, in theory, this embedding will be more similar to embeddings of documents that mention the sky than embeddings that don’t talk about the sky.

To find documents related to the user query, you compute the embedding and then find the top-N documents that have the most similar embedding. Then we place these documents (or summaries of these documents) in the hidden context for the bot to reference.

Notably, sometimes user queries are so short that the embedding isn’t particularly valuable. There is a clever technique described in [a paper published in December 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10496.pdf) called a “Hypothetical Document Embedding” or HyDE. Using this technique, you ask the model to generate a hypothetical document in response to the user’s query, and then compute the embedding for this generated document. The model  fabricates a document out of thin air – but the approach works!

The HyDE technique uses more calls to the model, but for many use cases has notable boosts in results.

[^5]: Usually referred to as a vector.
[^6]: The vector features are learned automatically, and the specific values aren’t directly interpretable by a human without some effort.

### Teach a Bot to Fish

Sometimes you’ll want the bot to have the capability to perform actions on the user’s behalf, like adding a memo to a receipt or plotting a chart. Or perhaps we want it to retrieve data in more nuanced ways than semantic search would allow for, like retrieving the past 90 days of expenses.

In these scenarios, we need to teach the bot how to fish.

#### Command Grammars

We can give the bot a list of commands for our system to interpret, along with descriptions and examples for the commands, and then have it produce programs composed of those commands.

There are many caveats to consider when going with this approach. With complex command grammars, the bot will tend to hallucinate commands or arguments that could plausibly exist, but don’t actually. The art to getting this right is enumerating commands that have relatively high levels of abstraction, while giving the bot sufficient flexibility to compose them in novel and useful ways.

For example, giving the bot a `plot-the-last-90-days-of-expenses` command is not particularly flexible or composable in what the bot can do with it. Similarly, a `draw-pixel-at-x-y [x] [y] [rgb]` command would be far too low-level. But giving the bot a `plot-expenses` and `list-expenses` command provides some good primitives that the bot has some flexibility with.

In an example below, we use this list of commands:

| Command | Arguments | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| list-expenses | budget | Returns a list of expenses for a given budget |
| converse | message | A message to show to the user |
| plot-expenses | expenses[] | Plots a list of expenses |
| get-budget-by-name | budget_name | Retrieves a budget by name |
| list-budgets | | Returns a list of budgets the user has access to |
| add-memo | inbox_item_id, memo message | Adds a memo to the provided inbox item |

We provide this table to the model in Markdown format, which the language model handles incredibly well – presumably because OpenAI trains heavily on data from GitHub.

In this example below, we ask the model to output the commands in [reverse polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)[^7].

[^7]: The model handles the simplicity of RPN astoundingly well.





> 🧠 There are some interesting subtle things going on in that example, beyond just command generation. When we ask it to add a memo to the “shake shack” expense, the model knows that the command `add-memo` takes an expense ID. But we never tell it the expense ID, so it looks up “Shake Shack” in the table of expenses we provided it, then grabs the ID from the corresponding ID column, and then uses that as an argument to `add-memo`.

Getting command grammars working reliably in complex situations can be tricky. The best levers we have here are to provide lots of descriptions, and as **many examples** of usage as we can. Large language models are [few-shot learners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Few-shot_learning_(natural_language_processing)), meaning that they can learn a new task by being provided just a few examples. In general, the more examples you provide the better off you’ll be – but that also eats into your token budget, so it’s a balance.

Here’s a more complex example, with the output specified in JSON instead of RPN. And we use Typescript to define the return types of commands.

This version is a bit easier to parse and interpret if your language of choice has a `JSON.parse` function.

> 🧙‍♂️ There is no industry established best format for defining a DSL for the model to generate programs. So consider this an area of active research. You will bump into limits. And as we overcome these limits, we may discover more optimal ways of defining commands.

#### ReAct

In March of 2023, Princeton and Google released a paper “[ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629.pdf)”, where they introduce a variant of command grammars that allows for fully autonomous interactive execution of actions and retrieval of data.

The model is instructed to return a `thought` and an `action` that it would like to perform. Another agent (e.g. our client) then performs the `action` and returns it to the model as an `observation`. The model will then loop to return more thoughts and actions until it returns an `answer`.

This is an incredibly powerful technique, effectively allowing the bot to be its own research assistant and possibly take actions on behalf of the user. Combined with a powerful command grammar, the bot should rapidly be able to answer a massive set of user requests.

In this example, we give the model a small set of commands related to getting employee data and searching wikipedia:

| Command | Arguments | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| find_employee | name | Retrieves an employee by name |
| get_employee | id | Retrieves an employee by ID |
| get_location | id | Retrieves a location by ID |
| get_reports | employee_id | Retrieves a list of employee ids that report to the employee associated with employee_id. |
| wikipedia | article | Retrieves a wikipedia article on a topic. |

We then ask the bot a simple question, “Is my manager famous?”.

We see that the bot:

1. First looks up our employee profile.
2. From our profile, gets our manager’s id and looks up their profile.
3. Extracts our manager’s name and searches for them on Wikipedia.
    - I chose a fictional character for the manager in this scenario.
4. The bot reads the wikipedia article and concludes that can’t be my manager since it is a fictional character.
5. The bot then modifies its search to include (real person).
6. Seeing that there are no results, the bot concludes that my manager is not famous.

#### GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5

In most of the examples in this doc, the difference between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 is negligible, but for “teaching a bot to fish” scenarios the difference between the models is notable.

None of the above examples of command grammars, for example, work without meaningful modifications for GPT-3.5. At a minimum, you have to provide a number of examples (at least one usage example per command) before you get any reasonable results. And, for complex sets of commands, it may hallucinate new commands or create fictional arguments.

With a sufficiently thorough hidden prompt, you should be able to overcome these limitations. GPT-4 is capable of far more consistent and complex logic with far simpler prompts (and can get by with zero or  small numbers of examples – though it is always beneficial to include as many as possible).

## Strategies

This section contains examples and strategies for specific needs or problems. For successful prompt engineering, you will need to combine some subset of all of the strategies enumerated in this document. Don’t be afraid to mix and match things – or invent your own approaches.

### Embedding Data

In hidden contexts, you’ll frequently want to embed all sorts of data. The specific strategy will vary depending on the type and quantity of data you are embedding.

#### Simple Lists

For one-off objects, enumerating fields + values in a normal bulleted list works pretty well:





It will also work for larger sets of things, but there are other formats for lists of data that GPT handles more reliably. Regardless, here’s an example:





#### Markdown Tables

Markdown tables are great for scenarios where you have many items of the same type to enumerate.

Fortunately, OpenAI’s models are exceptionally good at working with Markdown tables (presumably from the tons of GitHub data they’ve trained on).

We can reframe the above using Markdown tables instead:








> 🧠 Note that in this last example, the items in the table have an explicit date, February 2nd. In our question, we asked about “today”. And earlier in the prompt we mentioned that today was Feb 2. The model correctly handled the transitive inference – converting “today” to “February 2nd” and then looking up “February 2nd” in the table.

#### JSON

Markdown tables work really well for many use cases and should be preferred due to their density and ability for the model to handle them reliably, but you may run into scenarios where you have many columns and the model struggles with it or every item has some custom attributes and it doesn’t make sense to have dozens of columns of empty data.

In these scenarios, JSON is another format that the model handles really well. The close proximity of `keys` to their `values` makes it easy for the model to keep the mapping straight.

Here is the same example from the Markdown table, but with JSON instead:





#### Freeform Text

Occasionally you’ll want to include freeform text in a prompt that you would like to delineate from the rest of the prompt – such as embedding a document for the bot to reference. In these scenarios, surrounding the document with triple backticks, ```, works well[^8].





[^8]: A good rule of thumb for anything you’re doing in prompts is to lean heavily on things the model would have learned from GitHub.

#### Nested Data

Not all data is flat and linear. Sometimes you’ll need to embed data that is nested or has relations to other data. In these scenarios, lean on `JSON`:

> 🧠 The model works well with data in [3rd normal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form), but may struggle with too many joins. In experiments, it seems to do okay with at least three levels of nested joins. In the example above the model successfully joins from `users` to `addresses` to `cities` to infer the likely income for George – $90,000.

### Citations

Frequently, a natural language response isn’t sufficient on its own and you’ll want the model’s output to cite where it is getting data from. 

One useful thing to note here is that anything you might want to cite should have a unique ID. The simplest approach is to just ask the model to link to anything it references:






### Programmatic Consumption

By default, language models output natural language text, but frequently we need to interact with this result in a programmatic way that goes beyond simply printing it out on screen. You can achieve this by  asking the model to output the results in your favorite serialization format (JSON and YAML seem to work best).

Make sure you give the model an example of the output format you’d like. Building on our previous travel example above, we can augment our prompt to tell it:

~~~
Produce your output as JSON. The format should be:
```
{
    message: ""The message to show the user"",
    hotelId: 432,
    flightId: 831
}
```

Do not include the IDs in your message.
~~~

And now we’ll get interactions like this:





You could imagine the UI for this rendering the message as normal text, but then also adding discrete buttons for booking the flight + hotel, or auto-filling a form for the user.

As another example, let’s build on the [citations](#citations) example – but move beyond Markdown links. We can ask it to produce JSON with a normal message along with a list of items used in the creation of that message. In this scenario you won’t know exactly where in the message the citations were leveraged, but you’ll know that they were used somewhere.





> 🧠 Interestingly, in the model’s response to “How much did I spend at Target?” it provides a single value, $188.16, but **importantly** in the `citations` array it lists the individual expenses that it used to compute that value.

### Chain of Thought

Sometimes you will bang your head on a prompt trying to get the model to output reliable results, but, no matter what you do, it just won’t work. This will frequently happen when the bot’s final output requires intermediate thinking, but you ask the bot only for the output and nothing else.

The answer may surprise you: ask the bot to show its work. In October 2022, Google released a paper “[Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf)” where they showed that if, in your hidden prompt, you give the bot examples of answering questions by showing your work, then when you ask the bot to answer something it will show its work and produce more reliable answers.

Just a few weeks after that paper was published, at the end of October 2022, the University of Tokyo and Google released the paper “[Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=e2TBb5y0yFf)”, where they show that you don’t even need to provide examples – **you simply have to ask the bot to think step-by-step**.

#### Averaging

Here is an example where we ask the bot to compute the average expense, excluding Target. The actual answer is $136.77 and the bot almost gets it correct with $136.43.





If we simply add “Let’s think step-by-step”, the model gets the correct answer:





#### Interpreting Code

Let’s revisit the Python example from earlier and apply chain-of-thought prompting to our question. As a reminder, when we asked the bot to evaluate the Python code it gets it slightly wrong. The correct answer is `Hello, Brex!!Brex!!Brex!!!` but the bot gets confused about the number of !'s to include. In below’s example, it outputs `Hello, Brex!!!Brex!!!Brex!!!`:





If we ask the bot to show its work, then it gets the correct answer:





#### Delimiters

In many scenarios, you may not want to show the end user all of the bot’s thinking and instead just want to show the final answer. You can ask the bot to delineate the final answer from its thinking. There are many ways to do this, but let’s use JSON to make it easy to parse:





Using Chain-of-Thought prompting will consume more tokens, resulting in increased price and latency, but the results are noticeably more reliable for many scenarios. It’s a valuable tool to use when you need the bot to do something complex and as reliably as possible.

### Fine Tuning

Sometimes no matter what tricks you throw at the model, it just won’t do what you want it to do. In these scenarios you can **sometimes** fallback to fine-tuning. This should, in general, be a last resort.

[Fine-tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) is the process of taking an already trained model and then giving it thousands (or more) of example `input:output` pairs

It does not eliminate the need for hidden prompts, because you still need to embed dynamic data, but it may make the prompts smaller and more reliable.

#### Downsides

There are many downsides to fine-tuning. If it is at all possible, take advantage of the nature of language models being [zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Few-shot_learning_(natural_language_processing)) by teaching them to do something in their prompt rather than fine-tuning.

Some of the downsides include:

- **Not possible**: [GPT-3.5/GPT-4 isn’t fine tunable](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/is-fine-tuning-available-for-gpt-3-5-turbo), which is the primary model / API we’ll be using, so we simply can’t lean in fine-tuning.
- **Overhead**: Fine-tuning requires manually creating tons of data.
- **Velocity**: The iteration loop becomes much slower – every time you want to add a new capability, instead of adding a few lines to a prompt, you need to create a bunch of fake data and then run the finetune process and then use the newly fine-tuned model.
- **Cost**: It is up to 60x more expensive to use a fine-tuned GPT-3 model vs the stock `gpt-3.5-turbo` model. And it is 2x more expensive to use a fine-tuned GPT-3 model vs the stock GPT-4 model.

> ⛔️ If you fine-tune a model, **never use real customer data**. Always use synthetic data. The model may memorize portions of the data you provide and may regurgitate private data to other users that shouldn’t be seeing it.
>
> If you never fine-tune a model, we don’t have to worry about accidentally leaking data into the model.

semantic search need bot know little world common approach perform semantic searchhttpsgithubcomopenaiopenaicookbookblobmainexamplesquestionansweringusingembeddingsipynb semantic search oriented around document embedding think fixedlength array5 numbers number represents aspect document eg science document maybe 843rd number large art document 1115th number large overly simplistic conveys idea6 addition computing embedding document also compute embedding user query using function user asks sky blue compute embedding question theory embedding similar embeddings documents mention sky embeddings dont talk sky find documents related user query compute embedding find topn documents similar embedding place documents summaries documents hidden context bot reference notably sometimes user queries short embedding isnt particularly valuable clever technique described paper published december 2022httpsarxivorgpdf221210496pdf called hypothetical document embedding hyde using technique

XTLS/Trojan-killer,Go,"# Trojan-Killer

这个 POC 是为了 **狠 狠 打 脸** 某些认为 TLS in TLS 检测不存在或成本很高的人。

该程序在 `127.0.0.1:12345` 接收 TLS 流量，并用 **非 常 廉 价** 的方式检测出其中的 Trojan 代理。

1. 设置浏览器的 HTTP 代理至 `127.0.0.1:12345`，观察该程序的输出。
2. 设置 Trojan 链式 HTTP 代理至 `127.0.0.1:12345`，观察该程序的输出。

我们的测试结果如下：

1. 对于浏览器的 HTTPS 流量，**几乎没有阳性结果**。
2. 对于 Trojan 的 TLS in TLS 流量，**Trojan 字样直接刷屏**。

这与我们多次收到的 Trojan 被封、XTLS Vision 存活的反馈相符（它们均可选 lang 指纹）。

值得一提的是，根据我们的观察，目前 REALITY 的“白名单域名”会被豁免于这样的检测。

-- Enable the pgvector extension to work with embedding vectors
       create extension vector;

       -- Create a table to store your documents
       create table documents (
       id bigserial primary key,
       content text, -- corresponds to Document.pageContent
       metadata jsonb, -- corresponds to Document.metadata
       embedding vector(1536) -- 1536 works for OpenAI embeddings, change if needed
       );

       CREATE FUNCTION match_documents(query_embedding vector(1536), match_count int)
           RETURNS TABLE(
               id bigint,
               content text,
               metadata jsonb,
               -- we return matched vectors to enable maximal marginal relevance searches
               embedding vector(1536),
               similarity float)
           LANGUAGE plpgsql
           AS $$
           # variable_conflict use_column
       BEGIN

           SELECT
               id,
               content,
               metadata,
               embedding,
               1 -(documents.embedding <=> query_embedding) AS similarity
           FROM
               documents
           ORDER BY
               documents.embedding <=> query_embedding
           LIMIT match_count;
       END;

For more detailed information on setting up, developing, and deploying the ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin, refer to the full Development section below.

## About

### Plugins

Plugins are chat extensions designed specifically for language models like ChatGPT, enabling them to access up-to-date information, run computations, or interact with third-party services in response to a user's request. They unlock a wide range of potential use cases and enhance the capabilities of language models.

Developers can create a plugin by exposing an API through their website and providing a standardized manifest file that describes the API. ChatGPT consumes these files and allows the AI models to make calls to the API defined by the developer.

A plugin consists of:

- An API
- An API schema (OpenAPI JSON or YAML format)
- A manifest (JSON file) that defines relevant metadata for the plugin

The Retrieval Plugin already contains all of these components. Read the Chat Plugins blogpost [here](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins), and find the docs [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/introduction).

### Retrieval Plugin

This is a plugin for ChatGPT that enables semantic search and retrieval of personal or organizational documents. It allows users to obtain the most relevant document snippets from their data sources, such as files, notes, or emails, by asking questions or expressing needs in natural language. Enterprises can make their internal documents available to their employees through ChatGPT using this plugin.

The plugin uses OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` embeddings model to generate embeddings of document chunks, and then stores and queries them using a vector database on the backend. As an open-source and self-hosted solution, developers can deploy their own Retrieval Plugin and register it with ChatGPT. The Retrieval Plugin supports several vector database providers, allowing developers to choose their preferred one from a list.

A FastAPI server exposes the plugin's endpoints for upserting, querying, and deleting documents. Users can refine their search results by using metadata filters by source, date, author, or other criteria. The plugin can be hosted on any cloud platform that supports Docker containers, such as Fly.io, Heroku or Azure Container Apps. To keep the vector database updated with the latest documents, the plugin can process and store documents from various data sources continuously, using incoming webhooks to the upsert and delete endpoints. Tools like [Zapier](https://zapier.com) or [Make](https://www.make.com) can help configure the webhooks based on events or schedules.

### Memory Feature

A notable feature of the Retrieval Plugin is its capacity to provide ChatGPT with memory. By utilizing the plugin's upsert endpoint, ChatGPT can save snippets from the conversation to the vector database for later reference (only when prompted to do so by the user). This functionality contributes to a more context-aware chat experience by allowing ChatGPT to remember and retrieve information from previous conversations. Learn how to configure the Retrieval Plugin with memory [here](/examples/memory).

### Security

The Retrieval Plugin allows ChatGPT to search a vector database of content, and then add the best results into the ChatGPT session. This means it doesn’t have any external effects, and the main risk consideration is data authorization and privacy. Developers should only add content into their Retrieval Plugin that they have authorization for and that they are fine with appearing in users’ ChatGPT sessions. You can choose from a number of different authentication methods to secure the plugin (more information [here](#authentication-methods)).

### API Endpoints

The Retrieval Plugin is built using FastAPI, a web framework for building APIs with . FastAPI allows for easy development, validation, and documentation of API endpoints. Find the FastAPI documentation [here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

One of the benefits of using FastAPI is the automatic generation of interactive API documentation with Swagger UI. When the API is running locally, Swagger UI at `/docs` can be used to interact with the API endpoints, test their functionality, and view the expected request and response models.

The plugin exposes the following endpoints for upserting, querying, and deleting documents from the vector database. All requests and responses are in JSON format, and require a valid bearer token as an authorization header.

- `/upsert`: This endpoint allows uploading one or more documents and storing their text and metadata in the vector database. The documents are split into chunks of around 200 tokens, each with a unique ID. The endpoint expects a list of documents in the request body, each with a `text` field, and optional `id` and `metadata` fields. The `metadata` field can contain the following optional subfields: `source`, `source_id`, `url`, `created_at`, and `author`. The endpoint returns a list of the IDs of the inserted documents (an ID is generated if not initially provided).

- `/upsert-file`: This endpoint allows uploading a single file (PDF, TXT, DOCX, PPTX, or MD) and storing its text and metadata in the vector database. The file is converted to plain text and split into chunks of around 200 tokens, each with a unique ID. The endpoint returns a list containing the generated id of the inserted file.

- `/query`: This endpoint allows querying the vector database using one or more natural language queries and optional metadata filters. The endpoint expects a list of queries in the request body, each with a `query` and optional `filter` and `top_k` fields. The `filter` field should contain a subset of the following subfields: `source`, `source_id`, `document_id`, `url`, `created_at`, and `author`. The `top_k` field specifies how many results to return for a given query, and the default value is 3. The endpoint returns a list of objects that each contain a list of the most relevant document chunks for the given query, along with their text, metadata and similarity scores.

- `/delete`: This endpoint allows deleting one or more documents from the vector database using their IDs, a metadata filter, or a delete_all flag. The endpoint expects at least one of the following parameters in the request body: `ids`, `filter`, or `delete_all`. The `ids` parameter should be a list of document IDs to delete; all document chunks for the document with these IDS will be deleted. The `filter` parameter should contain a subset of the following subfields: `source`, `source_id`, `document_id`, `url`, `created_at`, and `author`. The `delete_all` parameter should be a boolean indicating whether to delete all documents from the vector database. The endpoint returns a boolean indicating whether the deletion was successful.

The detailed specifications and examples of the request and response models can be found by running the app locally and navigating to http://0.0.0.0:8000/openapi.json, or in the OpenAPI schema [here](/.well-known/openapi.yaml). Note that the OpenAPI schema only contains the `/query` endpoint, because that is the only function that ChatGPT needs to access. This way, ChatGPT can use the plugin only to retrieve relevant documents based on natural language queries or needs. However, if developers want to also give ChatGPT the ability to remember things for later, they can use the `/upsert` endpoint to save snippets from the conversation to the vector database. An example of a manifest and OpenAPI schema that gives ChatGPT access to the `/upsert` endpoint can be found [here](/examples/memory).

To include custom metadata fields, edit the `DocumentMetadata` and `DocumentMetadataFilter` data models [here](/models/models.py), and update the OpenAPI schema [here](/.well-known/openapi.yaml). You can update this easily by running the app locally, copying the JSON found at http://0.0.0.0:8000/sub/openapi.json, and converting it to YAML format with [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/). Alternatively, you can replace the `openapi.yaml` file with an `openapi.json` file.

## Development

### Setup

This app uses  3.10, and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.

Install  3.10 on your machine if it isn't already installed. It can be downloaded from the official [ website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or with a package manager like `brew` or `apt`, depending on your system.

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin.git
```

Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

```
cd /path/to/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin
```

Install poetry:

```
pip install poetry
```

Create a new virtual environment that uses  3.10:

```
poetry env use python3.10
poetry shell
```

Install app dependencies using poetry:

```
poetry install
```

**Note:** If adding dependencies in the `pyproject.toml`, make sure to run `poetry lock` and `poetry install`.

#### General Environment Variables

The API requires the following environment variables to work:

| Name             | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DATASTORE`      | Yes      | This specifies the vector database provider you want to use to store and query embeddings. You can choose from `chroma`, `pinecone`, `weaviate`, `zilliz`, `milvus`, `qdrant`, `redis`, `azuresearch`. |
| `BEARER_TOKEN`   | Yes      | This is a secret token that you need to authenticate your requests to the API. You can generate one using any tool or method you prefer, such as [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/).                |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes      | This is your OpenAI API key that you need to generate embeddings using the `text-embedding-ada-002` model. You can get an API key by creating an account on [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). |

### Using the plugin with Azure OpenAI

The Azure Open AI uses URLs that are specific to your resource and references models not by model name but by the deployment id. As a result, you need to set additional environment variables for this case.

In addition to the OPENAI_API_BASE (your specific URL) and OPENAI_API_TYPE (azure), you should also set OPENAI_EMBEDDINGMODEL_DEPLOYMENTID which specifies the model to use for getting embeddings on upsert and query. For this, we recommend deploying text-embedding-ada-002 model and using the deployment name here.

If you wish to use the data preparation scripts, you will also need to set OPENAI_METADATA_EXTRACTIONMODEL_DEPLOYMENTID, used for metadata extraction and
OPENAI_COMPLETIONMODEL_DEPLOYMENTID, used for PII handling.

### Choosing a Vector Database

The plugin supports several vector database providers, each with different features, performance, and pricing. Depending on which one you choose, you will need to use a different Dockerfile and set different environment variables. The following sections provide brief introductions to each vector database provider.

For more detailed instructions on setting up and using each vector database provider, please refer to the respective documentation in the `/docs/providers//setup.md` file ([folders here](/docs/providers)).

For detailed setup instructions, refer to [`/docs/providers/azuresearch/setup.md`](/docs/providers/azuresearch/setup.md)

### Running the API locally

To run the API locally, you first need to set the requisite environment variables with the `export` command:

```
export DATASTORE=
export BEARER_TOKEN=
export OPENAI_API_KEY=

```

Start the API with:

```
poetry run start
```

Append `docs` to the URL shown in the terminal and open it in a browser to access the API documentation and try out the endpoints (i.e. http://0.0.0.0:8000/docs). Make sure to enter your bearer token and test the API endpoints.

**Note:** If you add new dependencies to the pyproject.toml file, you need to run `poetry lock` and `poetry install` to update the lock file and install the new dependencies.

### Testing a Localhost Plugin in ChatGPT

To test a localhost plugin in ChatGPT, use the provided [`local-server/main.py`](/local-server/main.py) file, which is specifically configured for localhost testing with CORS settings, no authentication and routes for the manifest, OpenAPI schema and logo.

Follow these steps to test your localhost plugin:

1. Run the localhost server using the `poetry run dev` command. This starts the server at the default address (e.g. `localhost:3333`).

2. Visit [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), select ""Plugins"" from the model picker, click on the plugins picker, and click on ""Plugin store"" at the bottom of the list.

3. Choose ""Develop your own plugin"" and enter your localhost URL (e.g. `localhost:3333`) when prompted.

4. Your localhost plugin is now enabled for your ChatGPT session.

For more information, refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/getting-started/openapi-definition).

### Personalization

You can personalize the Retrieval Plugin for your own use case by doing the following:

- **Replace the logo**: Replace the image in [logo.png](/.well-known/logo.png) with your own logo.

- **Edit the data models**: Edit the `DocumentMetadata` and `DocumentMetadataFilter` data models in [models.py](/models/models.py) to add custom metadata fields. Update the OpenAPI schema in [openapi.yaml](/.well-known/openapi.yaml) accordingly. To update the OpenAPI schema more easily, you can run the app locally, then navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/sub/openapi.json` and copy the contents of the webpage. Then go to [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) and paste in the JSON to convert it to a YAML format. You could also replace the [openapi.yaml](/.well-known/openapi.yaml) file with an openapi.json file in the [.well-known](/.well-known) folder.

- **Change the plugin name, description, and usage instructions**: Update the plugin name, user-facing description, and usage instructions for the model. You can either edit the descriptions in the [main.py](/server/main.py) file or update the [openapi.yaml](/.well-known/openapi.yaml) file. Follow the same instructions as in the previous step to update the OpenAPI schema.

- **Enable ChatGPT to save information from conversations**: See the instructions in the [memory example folder](/examples/memory).

### Authentication Methods

You can choose from four options for authenticating requests to your plugin:

1. **No Authentication**: Anyone can add your plugin and use its API without any credentials. This option is suitable if you are only exposing documents that are not sensitive or already public. It provides no security for your data. If using this method, copy the contents of this [main.py](/examples/authentication-methods/no-auth/main.py) into the [actual main.py file](/server/main.py). Example manifest [here](/examples/authentication-methods/no-auth/ai-plugin.json).

2. **HTTP Bearer**: You can use a secret token as a header to authorize requests to your plugin. There are two variants of this option:

   - **User Level** (default for this implementation): Each user who adds your plugin to ChatGPT must provide the bearer token when adding the plugin. You can generate and distribute these tokens using any tool or method you prefer, such as [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/). This method provides better security as each user has to enter the shared access token. If you require a unique access token for each user, you will need to implement this yourself in the [main.py](/server/main.py) file. Example manifest [here](/examples/authentication-methods/user-http/ai-plugin.json).

   - **Service Level**: Anyone can add your plugin and use its API without credentials, but you must add a bearer token when registering the plugin. When you install your plugin, you need to add your bearer token, and will then receive a token from ChatGPT that you must include in your hosted manifest file. Your token will be used by ChatGPT to authorize requests to your plugin on behalf of all users who add it. This method is more convenient for users, but it may be less secure as all users share the same token and do not need to add a token to install the plugin. Example manifest [here](/examples/authentication-methods/service-http/ai-plugin.json).

3. **OAuth**: Users must go through an OAuth flow to add your plugin. You can use an OAuth provider to authenticate users who add your plugin and grant them access to your API. This method offers the highest level of security and control, as users authenticate through a trusted third-party provider. However, you will need to implement the OAuth flow yourself in the [main.py](/server/main.py) file and provide the necessary parameters in your manifest file. Example manifest [here](/examples/authentication-methods/oauth/ai-plugin.json).

Consider the benefits and drawbacks of each authentication method before choosing the one that best suits your use case and security requirements. If you choose to use a method different to the default (User Level HTTP), make sure to update the manifest file [here](/.well-known/ai-plugin.json).

## Deployment

You can deploy your app to different cloud providers, depending on your preferences and requirements. However, regardless of the provider you choose, you will need to update two files in your app: [openapi.yaml](/.well-known/openapi.yaml) and [ai-plugin.json](/.well-known/ai-plugin.json). As outlined above, these files define the API specification and the AI plugin configuration for your app, respectively. You need to change the url field in both files to match the address of your deployed app.

Before deploying your app, you might want to remove unused dependencies from your [pyproject.toml](/pyproject.toml) file to reduce the size of your app and improve its performance. Depending on the vector database provider you choose, you can remove the packages that are not needed for your specific provider. Refer to the respective documentation in the [`/docs/deployment/removing-unused-dependencies.md`](/docs/deployment/removing-unused-dependencies.md) file for information on removing unused dependencies for each provider.

Once you have deployed your app, consider uploading an initial batch of documents using one of [these scripts](/scripts) or by calling the `/upsert` endpoint.

- **Chroma:** Remove `pinecone-client`, `weaviate-client`, `pymilvus`, `qdrant-client`, and `redis`.
- **Pinecone:** Remove `chromadb`, `weaviate-client`, `pymilvus`, `qdrant-client`, and `redis`.
- **Weaviate:** Remove `chromadb`, `pinecone-client`, `pymilvus`, `qdrant-client`, and `redis`.
- **Zilliz:** Remove `chromadb`, `pinecone-client`, `weaviate-client`, `qdrant-client`, and `redis`.
- **Milvus:** Remove `chromadb`, `pinecone-client`, `weaviate-client`, `qdrant-client`, and `redis`.
- **Qdrant:** Remove `chromadb`, `pinecone-client`, `weaviate-client`, `pymilvus`, and `redis`.
- **Redis:** Remove `chromadb`, `pinecone-client`, `weaviate-client`, `pymilvus`, and `qdrant-client`.

- [Deploying to Fly.io](/docs/deployment/flyio.md)
- [Deploying to Heroku](/docs/deployment/heroku.md)
- [Other Deployment Options](/docs/deployment/other-options.md) (Azure Container Apps, Google Cloud Run, AWS Elastic Container Service, etc.)

After you create your app, make sure to change the plugin url in your plugin manifest file [here](/.well-known/ai-plugin.json), and in your OpenAPI schema [here](/.well-known/openapi.yaml), and redeploy.

## Installing a Developer Plugin

To install a developer plugin, follow the steps below:

- First, create your developer plugin by deploying it to your preferred hosting platform (e.g. Fly.io, Heroku, etc.) and updating the plugin URL in the manifest file and OpenAPI schema.

- Go to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and select ""Plugins"" from the model picker.

- From the plugins picker, scroll to the bottom and click on ""Plugin store.""

- Go to ""Develop your own plugin"" and follow the instructions provided. You will need to enter the domain where your plugin is deployed.

- Follow the instructions based on the authentication type you have chosen for your plugin (e.g. if your plugin uses Service Level HTTP, you will have to paste in your access token, then paste the new access token you receive from the plugin flow into your [ai-plugin.json](/.well-known/ai-plugin.json) file and redeploy your app).

- Next, you must add your plugin. Go to the ""Plugin store"" again and click on ""Install an unverified plugin.""

- Follow the instructions provided, which will require you to enter the domain where your plugin is deployed.

- Follow the instructions based on the authentication type you have chosen for your plugin (e.g. if your plugin uses User Level HTTP, you will have to paste in your bearer token).

After completing these steps, your developer plugin should be installed and ready to use in ChatGPT.

## Webhooks

To keep the documents stored in the vector database up-to-date, consider using tools like [Zapier](https://zapier.com) or [Make](https://www.make.com) to configure incoming webhooks to your plugin's API based on events or schedules. For example, this could allow you to sync new information as you update your notes or receive emails. You can also use a [Zapier Transfer](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-transfer-guide/) to batch process a collection of existing documents and upload them to the vector database.

If you need to pass custom fields from these tools to your plugin, you might want to create an additional Retrieval Plugin API endpoint that calls the datastore's upsert function, such as `upsert-email`. This custom endpoint can be designed to accept specific fields from the webhook and process them accordingly.

To set up an incoming webhook, follow these general steps:

- Choose a webhook tool like Zapier or Make and create an account.
- Set up a new webhook or transfer in the tool, and configure it to trigger based on events or schedules.
- Specify the target URL for the webhook, which should be the API endpoint of your retrieval plugin (e.g. `https://your-plugin-url.com/upsert`).
- Configure the webhook payload to include the necessary data fields and format them according to your retrieval plugin's API requirements.
- Test the webhook to ensure it's working correctly and sending data to your retrieval plugin as expected.

After setting up the webhook, you may want to run a backfill to ensure that any previously missed data is included in the vector database.

Remember that if you want to use incoming webhooks to continuously sync data, you should consider running a backfill after setting these up to avoid missing any data.

In addition to using tools like Zapier and Make, you can also build your own custom integrations to sync data with your Retrieval Plugin. This allows you to have more control over the data flow and tailor the integration to your specific needs and requirements.

## Scripts

The `scripts` folder contains scripts to batch upsert or process text documents from different data sources, such as a zip file, JSON file, or JSONL file. These scripts use the plugin's upsert utility functions to upload the documents and their metadata to the vector database, after converting them to plain text and splitting them into chunks. Each script folder has a README file that explains how to use it and what parameters it requires. You can also optionally screen the documents for personally identifiable information (PII) using a language model and skip them if detected, with the [`services.pii_detection`](/services/pii_detection.py) module. This can be helpful if you want to avoid uploading sensitive or private documents to the vector database unintentionally. Additionally, you can optionally extract metadata from the document text using a language model, with the [`services.extract_metadata`](/services/extract_metadata.py) module. This can be useful if you want to enrich the document metadata. **Note:** if using incoming webhooks to continuously sync data, consider running a backfill after setting these up to avoid missing any data.

The scripts are:

- [`process_json`](scripts/process_json/): This script processes a file dump of documents in a JSON format and stores them in the vector database with some metadata. The format of the JSON file should be a list of JSON objects, where each object represents a document. The JSON object should have a `text` field and optionally other fields to populate the metadata. You can provide custom metadata as a JSON string and flags to screen for PII and extract metadata.
- [`process_jsonl`](scripts/process_jsonl/): This script processes a file dump of documents in a JSONL format and stores them in the vector database with some metadata. The format of the JSONL file should be a newline-delimited JSON file, where each line is a valid JSON object representing a document. The JSON object should have a `text` field and optionally other fields to populate the metadata. You can provide custom metadata as a JSON string and flags to screen for PII and extract metadata.
- [`process_zip`](scripts/process_zip/): This script processes a file dump of documents in a zip file and stores them in the vector database with some metadata. The format of the zip file should be a flat zip file folder of docx, pdf, txt, md, pptx or csv files. You can provide custom metadata as a JSON string and flags to screen for PII and extract metadata.

## Limitations

While the ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin is designed to provide a flexible solution for semantic search and retrieval, it does have some limitations:

- **Keyword search limitations**: The embeddings generated by the `text-embedding-ada-002` model may not always be effective at capturing exact keyword matches. As a result, the plugin might not return the most relevant results for queries that rely heavily on specific keywords. Some vector databases, like Pinecone, Weaviate and Azure Cognitive Search, use hybrid search and might perform better for keyword searches.
- **Sensitive data handling**: The plugin does not automatically detect or filter sensitive data. It is the responsibility of the developers to ensure that they have the necessary authorization to include content in the Retrieval Plugin and that the content complies with data privacy requirements.
- **Scalability**: The performance of the plugin may vary depending on the chosen vector database provider and the size of the dataset. Some providers may offer better scalability and performance than others.
- **Language support**: The plugin currently uses OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model, which is optimized for use in English. However, it is still robust enough to generate good results for a variety of languages.
- **Metadata extraction**: The optional metadata extraction feature relies on a language model to extract information from the document text. This process may not always be accurate, and the quality of the extracted metadata may vary depending on the document content and structure.
- **PII detection**: The optional PII detection feature is not foolproof and may not catch all instances of personally identifiable information. Use this feature with caution and verify its effectiveness for your specific use case.

## Future Directions

The ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin provides a flexible solution for semantic search and retrieval, but there is always potential for further development. We encourage users to contribute to the project by submitting pull requests for new features or enhancements. Notable contributions may be acknowledged with OpenAI credits.

Some ideas for future directions include:

- **More vector database providers**: If you are interested in integrating another vector database provider with the ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin, feel free to submit an implementation.
- **Additional scripts**: Expanding the range of scripts available for processing and uploading documents from various data sources would make the plugin even more versatile.
- **User Interface**: Developing a user interface for managing documents and interacting with the plugin could improve the user experience.
- **Hybrid search / TF-IDF option**: Enhancing the [datastore's upsert function](/datastore/datastore.py#L18) with an option to use hybrid search or TF-IDF indexing could improve the plugin's performance for keyword-based queries.
- **Advanced chunking strategies and embeddings calculations**: Implementing more sophisticated chunking strategies and embeddings calculations, such as embedding document titles and summaries, performing weighted averaging of document chunks and summaries, or calculating the average embedding for a document, could lead to better search results.
- **Custom metadata**: Allowing users to add custom metadata to document chunks, such as titles or other relevant information, might improve the retrieved results in some use cases.
- **Additional optional services**: Integrating more optional services, such as summarizing documents or pre-processing documents before embedding them, could enhance the plugin's functionality and quality of retrieved results. These services could be implemented using language models and integrated directly into the plugin, rather than just being available in the scripts.

We welcome contributions from the community to help improve the ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin and expand its capabilities. If you have an idea or feature you'd like to contribute, please submit a pull request to the repository.

Bing-su/adetailer,Python,"# !After Detailer

!After Detailer is a extension for stable diffusion webui, similar to Detection Detailer, except it uses ultralytics instead of the mmdet.

## Install

(from Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet)

1. Open ""Extensions"" tab.
2. Open ""Install from URL"" tab in the tab.
3. Enter `https://github.com/Bing-su/adetailer.git` to ""URL for extension's git repository"".
4. Press ""Install"" button.
5. Wait 5 seconds, and you will see the message ""Installed into stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\adetailer. Use Installed tab to restart"".
6. Go to ""Installed"" tab, click ""Check for updates"", and then click ""Apply and restart UI"". (The next time you can also use this method to update extensions.)
7. Completely restart A1111 webui including your terminal. (If you do not know what is a ""terminal"", you can reboot your computer: turn your computer off and turn it on again.)

You **DON'T** need to download any model from huggingface.

## Usage

It's auto detecting, masking, and inpainting tool.

So some options correspond to options on the inpaint tab.

Other options:

| Option                                 |                                                                                              |                                                                                         |

| Mask x, y offset                       | Moves the mask horizontally and vertically by pixels.                                        |                                                                                         |                                                                 |

## ControlNet Inpainting

You can use the ControlNet inpaint extension if you have ControlNet installed and a ControlNet inpaint model.

On the ControlNet tab, select a ControlNet inpaint model and set the model weights.

The yolo models can be found on huggingface [Bingsu/adetailer](https://huggingface.co/Bingsu/adetailer).

### User Model

Put your [ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) model in `webui/models/adetailer`. The model name should end with `.pt` or `.pth`.

It must be a bbox detection or segment model and use all label.

### Dataset

Open-source platform for building AI-powered virtual software developers

Website |
  Discord |
  Twitter










![e2b-editor](docs-assets/preview.gif)

[e2b](https://e2b.dev) or etob (*english2bits*) allows you to create & deploy virtual software developers. These virtual developers are powered by specialized AI agents that build software based on your instructions and can use tools.

Agents operate in our own secure sandboxed cloud environments that's powered by [Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/).

e2b currently supports building only REST servers in Node.js. Specifically using the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework. We'll support more use-cases with time.

# 🚀 Get started
We're working on the cloud-hosted version. In the meantime, the fastest way try out e2b is to run it locally via Docker.

## 🐳 Start e2b with Docker
You will need:
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (support for more and custom models coming soon)
- Docker
- Node.js *16+*
- Free ports 3000 (Next.js app), 54321 (Supabase API Gateway), 54322 (Supabase Database)

To start e2b run:
```
npm start
```

Then open page on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

`npm start` starts local Supabase in the background - to stop it you have to run `npm run stop`.

## 💻 Development setup
For developing with hot reloading and contributing to the project you may want to run the app locally without Docker (`npm start` command).

[Follow these steps](DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md) to set it up.

# Features
## 🛠 Bring your own X
While e2b will offer the ""batteries-included"" solution, our goal is to let users:
- **BYOM** - Bring Your Own Model
- **BYOP** - Bring Your Own Prompt
- **BYOT** - Bring Your Own Tools

## 🤖 Supported models and model hosting providers
- [x] [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
  - [x] GPT-4
  - [x] GTP-3.5
- [x] [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com/)

Open-source developer infrastructure for internal tools. Self-hostable alternative to Airplane, Pipedream, Superblocks and a simplified Temporal with autogenerated UIsm and custom UIs to trigger workflows and scripts as internal apps. Scripts are turned into UIs and no-code modules, no-code modules can be composed into very rich flows, and script and flows can be triggered from internal UIs made with a low-code builder. The script languages supported are: Python, Typescript, Go, Bash, SQL.

## Main Concepts

1. Define a minimal and generic script in Python, Typescript, Go or Bash that
   solves a specific task. Here sending an email with SMTP. The code can be
   defined in the provided Web IDE or synchronized with your own github repo:
   ![Step 1](./imgs/windmill-editor.png)

2. Your scripts parameters are automatically parsed and generate a frontend.
   ![Step 2](./imgs/windmill-run.png) ![Step 3](./imgs/windmill-result.png)

3. Make it flow! You can chain your scripts or scripts made by the community
   shared on [WindmillHub](https://hub.windmill.dev).
   ![Step 3](./imgs/windmill-flow.png)

4. Build complex UI on top of your scripts and flows.
   ![Step 4](./imgs/windmill-builder.png)

Scripts and flows can also be triggered by a cron schedule '_/5 _ \* \* \*' or
through webhooks.

You can build your entire infra on top of Windmill!

## Show me some actual script code

```typescript
import * as wmill from ""https://deno.land/x/windmill@v1.62.0/mod.ts"";
//import any dependency  from npm

import cowsay from ""npm:cowsay@1.5.0"";

export async function main(
  a: number,
  // unions generate enums
  b: ""my"" | ""enum"",
  // default parameters prefill the field
  d = ""default arg"",
  // nested objects work c = { nested: ""object"" },
  // permissioned and typed json
  db: wmill.Resource<""postgresql"">
) {
  const email = Deno.env.get(""WM_EMAIL"");
  // variables are permissioned and by path
  let variable = await wmill.getVariable(""f/company-folder/my_secret"");
  const lastTimeRun = await wmill.getState();
  // logs are printed and always inspectable
  console.log(cowsay.say({ text: ""hello "" + email + "" "" + lastTimeRun }));
  await wmill.setState(Date.now());

  // return is serialized as JSON
  return { foo: d, variable };
}
```

## CLI

We have a powerful CLI to interact with the windmill platform and sync your
scripts from local files, github repos and to run scripts and flows on the
instance from local commands. See
[more details](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/tree/main/cli)

![CLI Screencast](./cli/vhs/output/setup.gif)

### Running scripts locally

You can run your script locally easily, you simply need to pass the right
environment variables for the `wmill` client library to fetch resources and
variables from your instance if necessary. See more:


## Stack

- Postgres as the database
- backend in Rust with the following highly-available and horizontally scalable
  architecture:
  - stateless API backend
  - workers that pull jobs from a queue in Postgres (and later, Kafka or Redis.
    Upvote [#173](#https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/issues/173) if
    interested )
- frontend in Svelte
- scripts executions are sandboxed using google's
  [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail)
- javascript runtime is the
  [deno_core rust library](https://denolib.gitbook.io/guide/) (which itself uses
  the [rusty_v8](https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8) and hence V8 underneath)
- typescript runtime is deno
- python runtime is python3
- golang runtime is 1.19.1

## Security

### Sandboxing

Windmill uses [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail) on top of the deno
sandboxing. It is production multi-tenant grade secure. Do not take our word for
it, take [fly.io's one](https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/)

### Secrets, credentials and sensitive values

There is one encryption key per workspace to encrypt the credentials and secrets
stored in Windmill's K/V store.

In addition, we strongly recommend that you encrypt the whole Postgres database.
That is what we do at .

## Performance

Once a job started, there is no overhead compared to running the same script on
the node with its corresponding runner (Deno/Go/Python/Bash). The added latency
from a job being pulled from the queue, started, and then having its result sent
back to the database is ~50ms. A typical lightweight deno job will take around
100ms total.

## Architecture





## How to self-host

We only provide docker-compose setup here. For more advanced setups, like
compiling from source or using without a postgres super user, see
[documentation](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/self_host)

### Docker compose

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/Caddyfile -o Caddyfile
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/.env -o .env

docker compose up -d --pull always
```

Go to http://localhost et voilà :)

The default super-admin user is: admin@windmill.dev / changeme

From there, you can follow the setup app and creat other users.

### Kubernetes (k8s) and Helm charts

We publish helm charts at:


### Postgres without superuser

If you do not want, or cannot (for instance, in AWS Aurora or Cloud sql) use a
postgres superuser, you can run `./init-db-as-superuser.sql` to init the
required users for windmill.

### Commercial license

To self-host Windmill, you must respect the terms of the AGPLv3 license which
you do not need to worry about for personal uses. For business uses, you should
be fine if you do not re-expose it in any way Windmill to your users and are
comfortable with AGPLv3.

To re-expose any Windmill parts to your users as a feature of your product, or
to build a feature on top of Windmill, to comply with AGPLv3 your product must
be AGPLv3 or you must get a commercial license. Contact us at
 if you have any doubts.

In addition, a commercial license grants you a dedicated engineer to transition
your current infrastructure to Windmill, support with tight SLA, and our global
cache sync for high-performance/no dependency cache miss of cluster from 10+
nodes to 200+ nodes.

### OAuth for self-hosting

To get the same oauth integrations as Windmill Cloud, mount `oauth.json` with
the following format:

```json
{
  """": {
    ""id"": """",
    ""secret"": """",
    ""allowed_domains"": [""windmill.dev""] //restrict a client OAuth login to some domains
  }
}
```

and mount it at `/usr/src/app/oauth.json`.

The redirect url for the oauth clients is:
`/user/login_callback/`

[The list of all possible ""connect an app"" oauth clients](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/blob/main/backend/oauth_connect.json)

To add more ""connect an app"" OAuth clients to the Windmill project, read the
[Contributor's guide](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/misc/contributing). We
welcome contributions!

You may also add your own custom OAuth2 IdP and OAuth2 Resource provider:

```json
{
  """": {
    ""id"": """",
    ""secret"": """",
    // To add a new OAuth2 IdP
    ""login_config"": {
      ""auth_url"": """",
      ""token_url"": """",
      ""userinfo_url"": """",
      ""scopes"": [""scope1"", ""scope2""],
      ""extra_params"": """"
    },
    // To add a new OAuth2 Resource
    ""connect_config"": {
      ""auth_url"": """",
      ""token_url"": """",
      ""scopes"": [""scope1"", ""scope2""],
      ""extra_params"": """"
    }
  }

## Run a local dev setup

### only Frontend

This will use the backend of  but your own frontend
with hot-code reloading.

1. Install [caddy](https://caddyserver.com)
2. Go to `frontend/`:
   1. `npm install`, `npm run generate-backend-client` then `npm run dev`
   2. In another shell `sudo caddy run --config CaddyfileRemote`
3. Et voilà, windmill should be available at `http://localhost/`

### Backend + Frontend

See the [./frontend/README_DEV.md](./frontend/README_DEV.md) file for all
running options.

1. Create a Postgres Database for Windmill and create an admin role inside your
   Postgres setup. The easiest way to get a working postgres is running
   `cargo install sqlx-cli && sqlx migrate run`. This will also avoid compile
   time issue with sqlx's `query!` macro
2. Install [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail) and have it accessible in
   your PATH
3. Install deno and python3, have the bins at `/usr/bin/deno` and
   `/usr/local/bin/python3`
4. Install [caddy](https://caddyserver.com)
5. Install the [lld linker](https://lld.llvm.org/)
6. Go to `frontend/`:
   1. `npm install`, `npm run generate-backend-client` then `npm run dev`
   2. In another shell `npm run build` otherwise the backend will not find the
      `frontend/build` folder and will crash
   3. In another shell `sudo caddy run --config Caddyfile`
7. Go to `backend/`:
   `DATABASE_URL= RUST_LOG=info cargo run`
8. Et voilà, windmill should be available at `http://localhost/`

`redux-form` works with [React Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) to
enable an html form in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) to use
[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) to store all of its state.

## ⚠️ ATTENTION ⚠️

If you're just getting started with your application and are looking for a form solution, the [general consensus of the community](https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/1124771065115185152) is that you should _not_ put your form state in Redux. The author of Redux Form took all of the lessons he learned about form use cases from maintaining Redux Form and built [🏁 React Final Form](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form#-react-final-form), which he recommends you use if you are just starting your project. It's also pretty easy to migrate to from Redux Form, because the `` component APIs are so similar. [Here is a blog post](https://codeburst.io/final-form-the-road-to-the-checkered-flag-cd9b75c25fe) where he explains his reasoning, or [there are two talks](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form#videos) if you prefer video. [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/) is also a nice solution.

The only good reason, [in the author's view](https://twitter.com/erikras/status/1035082880341483520), to use Redux Form in your application is if you need _really_ tight coupling of your form data with Redux, specifically if you need to subscribe to it and modify it from parts of your application far from your form component, e.g. on another route. If you don't have that requirement, use [🏁 React Final Form](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form#-react-final-form).

Modern Modal Editing





















## Introduction

Oni is a new kind of editor, focused on maximizing productivity - combining _modal editing_ with features you expect in modern editors. Oni is built with [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), and inspired by [VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [LightTable](http://lighttable.com/), and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

The vision of Oni is to build an editor that allows you to go from _thought to code_ as easily as possible - bringing together the raw editing power of Vim, the feature capabilities of Atom/VSCode, and a powerful and intuitive extensibility model - wrapped up in a beautiful package.





Check out [Releases](https://github.com/onivim/oni/releases) for the latest binaries, or [Build Oni](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Development) from source. Consider making a donation via [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/oni) [BountySource](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/oni) if you find this project useful!

## Features

Oni brings several IDE-like integrations to neovim:

*   [Embedded Browser](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Features#embedded-browser)
*   [Quick Info](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Features#quick-info)
*   [Code Completion](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Features#code-completion)
*   [Syntax / Compilation Errors](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Features#syntax--compilation-errors)
*   [Fuzzy Finding](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Features#fuzzy-finder)
*   [Status Bar](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Features#status-bar)
*   [Interactive Tutorial](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Features#interactive-tutorial)

And more coming - check out our [Roadmap](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Roadmap)

Oni is cross-platform and supports Windows, Mac, and Linux.

> If you're a Vim power user, and don't need all these features, check out our [minimal configuration](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/How-To:-Minimal-Oni-Configuration).

## Installation

We have installation guides for each platform:

*   [Windows](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Installation-Guide#windows)
*   [Mac](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Installation-Guide#mac)
*   [Linux](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Installation-Guide#linux)

The latest binaries are available on our [Releases](https://github.com/onivim/oni/releases) page, and if you'd prefer to build from source, check out our [Development](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Development) guide.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to provide both the full-fledged Vim experience, with no compromises, while pushing forward to enable new productivity scenarios.

*   **Modern UX** - The Vim experience should not be compromised by terminal limitations.
*   **Rich plugin development** - using JavaScript, instead of VimL.
*   **Cross-platform support** - across Windows, OS X, and Linux.
*   **Batteries included** - rich features are available out of the box - minimal setup needed to be productive.
*   **Performance** - no compromises, Vim is fast, and Oni should be fast too.
*   **Ease Learning Curve** - without sacrificing the Vim experience.

Vim is an incredible tool for manipulating _text_ at the speed of thought. With a composable, modal command language, it is no wonder that Vim usage is still prevalent today.

However, going from thought to _code_ has some different challenges than going from thought to _text_. Code editors today provide several benefits that help to reduce **cognitive load** when writing code, and that benefit is tremendously important - not only in terms of pure coding efficiency and productivity, but also in making the process of writing code enjoyable and fun.

The goal of this project is to give an editor that gives the best of both worlds - the power, speed, and flexibility of using Vim for manipulating text, as well as the rich tooling that comes with an IDE. We want to make coding as efficient, fast, and fun as we can!

Effeckt.css
===========


**A Performant Transitions and Animations Library** : [http://h5bp.github.io/Effeckt.css](http://h5bp.github.io/Effeckt.css)

Ever notice how small flourishes and subtle transitions dramatically increases the value of the experience you enjoy with an app or site?

Designing and developing UIs for the mobile web is tricky, but it's extremely difficult to do that while delivering something that performs at 60fps. The best opportunities to getting jank-free transitions on phones/tablets are  transition and keyframe animation based, especially tapping into hardware-accelerated transforms and opacity changes.

@daneden did really nice work with [Animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate/) but I think the web would benefit if we could take that work to the next level. There's already been fantastic experiments and demos exploring -based transitions, but it's distributed all over.

* [lab.hakim.se/meny/](http://lab.hakim.se/meny/)

Because there are so many, I expect we could **group things by role**:

* button/touch effects
* state transition
* modal/notification transition
* attention attractors

## Goals

1. Provide a minimal UI. Only use style hooks for transitions and animations.
1. Designer-curated set of classy and reasonable effects. (no [`easeInBounce`](http://easings.net/#easeInBounce))
1. Establish browser support guidelines (e.g. Android 2.3 would gracefully degrade)
1.  performance regression testing (a la [bench.topcoat.io](http://bench.topcoat.io))
1. Deliver jank-free *60fps* performance on target browsers/devices
1. If a particular effect cannot deliver target performance (hey `blur()` css filter), it cannot be included.
1. Guidelines on what to avoid when styling these affected elements (avoid expensive )
1. Deliver a builder so users can pull only the  they need.
1. There is no hover on the mobile web, so any hover-based effects would be excluded or have a tap-based equivalent.

## Action

* If you know other transition/animation based demos/experiments that make sense to include here, file a ticket.
* If you're interested in helping to define the API, let's hear it! File a ticket.
* A web-based builder is a must. A command-line builder isn't important for this.

nbedos/termtosvg,Python,"**Note: As of June 2020 I do not have time to maintain termtosvg anymore and this repository is now read-only.**

# termtosvg
termtosvg is a Unix terminal recorder written in  that renders your command
line sessions as standalone SVG animations.

![Example](./docs/examples/awesome_window_frame_powershell.svg)

* [Gallery of examples](https://nbedos.github.io/termtosvg/pages/examples.html)
* [Gallery of templates](https://nbedos.github.io/termtosvg/pages/templates.html)

## Features
* Produce lightweight and clean looking animations or still frames embeddable on a project page
* Custom color themes, terminal UI and animation controls via user-defined [SVG templates](man/termtosvg-templates.md)
* Rendering of recordings in asciicast format made with asciinema
    
## Installation
termtosvg is compatible with Linux, macOS and BSD OSes, requires  >= 3.5 and can be installed as follows using pip:
```shell
# Create virtualenv named '.venv'
python3 -m venv .venv
# Activate virtualenv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install termtosvg
```
Then run termtosvg by calling either `termtosvg` or `python3 -m termtosvg`.

Various independently maintained, OS specific packages have been made available by the community:

| OS       | Repository  | Installation command  |
|----------|-------------|---|
| Archlinux  | [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/termtosvg/)  |`pacman -S termtosvg`   |
| FreeBSD | [ports](https://www.freshports.org/graphics/py-termtosvg) | |
| Gentoo | [media-gfx/termtosvg](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/media-gfx/termtosvg) | `emerge media-gfx/termtosvg`|
| macOS  | [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/termtosvg)  |`brew install termtosvg`   |
| OpenBSD  | [ports](https://github.com/openbsd/ports/tree/master/graphics/termtosvg)  |   |
| NixOS | [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/tools/misc/termtosvg/) | |


## Basic usage
Start recording with:

```
$ termtosvg
Recording started, enter ""exit"" command or Control-D to end
```

You are now in a subshell where you can type your commands as usual.
Once you are done, exit the shell to end the recording:

```
$ exit
Recording ended, file is /tmp/termtosvg_exp5nsr4.svg
```
Then, use your favorite web browser to play the animation:
```
$ firefox /tmp/termtosvg_exp5nsr4.svg
```

Finally, embedding the animation in e.g. a [README.md](README.md) file on GitHub can
be achieved with a relative link to the animation:
```markdown
![Example](./docs/examples/awesome_window_frame.svg)
```

See the [manual page](man/termtosvg.md) for more details.

## Dependencies
termtosvg uses:
* [pyte](https://github.com/selectel/pyte) to render the terminal screen
* [lxml](https://github.com/lxml/lxml) to work with SVG data

[![Build Status][build-status-svg]][build-status-link]

A conforming WebSocket ([RFC 6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455>)) client library for iOS, macOS and tvOS.

Test results for SocketRocket [here](http://facebook.github.io/SocketRocket/results/).
You can compare to what modern browsers look like [here](http://autobahn.ws/testsuite/reports/clients/index.html).

SocketRocket currently conforms to all core ~300 of [Autobahn](http://autobahn.ws/testsuite/>)'s fuzzing tests 
(aside from two UTF-8 ones where it is merely *non-strict* tests 6.4.2 and 6.4.4).

## Features/Design

- TLS (wss) support, including self-signed certificates.
- Seems to perform quite well.
- Supports HTTP Proxies.
- Supports IPv4/IPv6.
- Supports SSL certificate pinning.
- Sends `ping` and can process `pong` events.
- Asynchronous and non-blocking. Most of the work is done on a background thread.
- Supports iOS, macOS, tvOS.

## Installing

There are a few options. Choose one, or just figure it out:

- **[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)**

 Add the following line to your Podfile:
 ```ruby
 pod 'SocketRocket'
 ```
 Run `pod install`, and you are all set.
  
- **[Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage)**

 Add the following line to your Cartfile:
 ```
 github ""facebook/SocketRocket""
 ```
 Run `carthage update`, and you should now have the latest version of `SocketRocket` in your `Carthage` folder.

- **Using SocketRocket as a sub-project**

  You can also include `SocketRocket` as a subproject inside of your application if you'd prefer, although we do not recommend this, as it will increase your indexing time significantly. To do so, just drag and drop the `SocketRocket.xcodeproj` file into your workspace.

## API

### `SRWebSocket`

The Web Socket.

#### Note:

`SRWebSocket` will retain itself between `-(void)open` and when it closes, errors, or fails.
This is similar to how `NSURLConnection` behaves (unlike `NSURLConnection`, `SRWebSocket` won't retain the delegate).

#### Interface

```objective-c
@interface SRWebSocket : NSObject

// Make it with this
- (instancetype)initWithURLRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request;

// Set this before opening
@property (nonatomic, weak) id  delegate;

// Open with this
- (void)open;

// Close it with this
- (void)close;

// Send a Data
- (void)sendData:(nullable NSData *)data error:(NSError **)error;

// Send a UTF8 String
- (void)sendString:(NSString *)string error:(NSError **)error;

@end
```

### `SRWebSocketDelegate`

You implement this

```objective-c
@protocol SRWebSocketDelegate 

@optional

- (void)webSocketDidOpen:(SRWebSocket *)webSocket;

- (void)webSocket:(SRWebSocket *)webSocket didReceiveMessageWithString:(NSString *)string;
- (void)webSocket:(SRWebSocket *)webSocket didReceiveMessageWithData:(NSData *)data;

- (void)webSocket:(SRWebSocket *)webSocket didFailWithError:(NSError *)error;
- (void)webSocket:(SRWebSocket *)webSocket didCloseWithCode:(NSInteger)code reason:(nullable NSString *)reason wasClean:(BOOL)wasClean;

@end
```

## Testing

Included are setup scripts for the python testing environment.
It comes packaged with vitualenv so all the dependencies are installed in userland.

To run the short test from the command line, run:
```bash
  make test
```

To run all the tests, run:
```bash
  make test_all
```

The short tests don't include the performance tests
(the test harness is actually the bottleneck, not SocketRocket).

The first time this is run, it may take a while to install the dependencies. It will be smooth sailing after that. 

You can also run tests inside Xcode, which runs the same thing, but makes it easier to debug.

- Choose the `SocketRocketTests` target
- Make sure your running destination is either your Mac or any Simulator
- Run the test action (`⌘+U`)

### TestChat Demo Application

SocketRocket includes a demo app, TestChat.
It will ""chat"" with a listening websocket on port 9900.

#### TestChat Server

The sever takes a message and broadcasts it to all other connected clients.

It requires some dependencies though to run. 
We also want to reuse the virtualenv we made when we ran the tests. 
If you haven't run the tests yet, go into the SocketRocket root directory and type:

```bash
make test
```

This will set up your [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv).

Now, in your terminal:

```bash
source .env/bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado.git
```

In the same terminal session, start the chatroom server:

```bash
python TestChatServer/py/chatroom.py
```

There's also a Go implementation (with the latest weekly) where you can:

```bash
cd TestChatServer/go
go run chatroom.go
```

#### Chatting

Now, start TestChat.app (just run the target in the Xcode project).
If you had it started already you can hit the refresh button to reconnect.
It should say ""Connected!"" on top.

To talk with the app, open up your browser to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) and start chatting.


## WebSocket Server Implementation Recommendations

SocketRocket has been used with the following libraries:

- [Tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado)
- Go's [WebSocket package](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/websocket) or Gorilla's [version](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/websocket).
- [Autobahn](http://autobahn.ws/testsuite/) (using its fuzzing client).

The Tornado one is dirt simple and works like a charm. 
([IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html) uses it too).
It's much easier to configure handlers and routes than in Autobahn/twisted.

## Install

Install the latest stable version of HackMyResume with NPM:

```bash
[sudo] npm install hackmyresume -g
```

Alternately, install the latest bleeding-edge version (updated daily):

```bash
[sudo] npm install hacksalot/hackmyresume#dev -g
```

## Installing PDF Support (optional)

HackMyResume tries not to impose a specific PDF engine requirement on
the user, but will instead work with whatever PDF engines you have installed.

Currently, HackMyResume's PDF generation requires one of [Phantom.js][2],
[wkhtmltopdf][3], or [WeasyPrint][11] to be installed on your system and the
corresponding binary to be accessible on your PATH. This is an optional
requirement for users who care about PDF formats. If you don't care about PDF
formats, skip this step.

## Installing Themes

HackMyResume supports both [FRESH][fresh-themes] and [JSON Resume][jrst]-style
résumé themes.

- FRESH themes currently come preinstalled with HackMyResume.
- JSON Resume themes can be installed from NPM, GitHub, or manually.

To install a JSON Resume theme, just `cd` to the folder where you want to store
your themes and run one of:

```bash
# Install with NPM
npm install jsonresume-theme-[theme-name]

# Install with GitHub
git clone https://github.com/[user-or-org]/[repo-name]
```

Then when you're ready to generate your resume, just reference the location of
the theme folder as you installed it:

```bash
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out/resume.all -t node_modules/jsonresume-theme-classy
```

Note: You can use install themes anywhere on your file system. You don't need a
package.json or other NPM/Node infrastructure.

## Getting Started

To use HackMyResume you'll need to create a valid resume in either
[FRESH][fresca] or [JSON Resume][6] format. Then you can start using the command
line tool. There are five basic commands you should be aware of:

- **build** generates resumes in HTML, Word, Markdown, PDF, and other formats.
Use it when you need to submit, upload, print, or email resumes in specific
formats.

    ```bash
    # hackmyresume build  TO  [-t THEME]
    hackmyresume build resume.json TO out/resume.all
    hackmyresume build r1.json r2.json TO out/rez.html out/rez.md foo/rez.all
    ```

- **new** creates a new resume in FRESH or JSON Resume format.

    ```bash
    # hackmyresume new  [-f ]
    hackmyresume new resume.json
    hackmyresume new resume.json -f fresh
    hackmyresume new r1.json r2.json -f jrs
    ```

- **analyze** inspects your resume for keywords, duration, and other metrics.

    ```bash
    # hackmyresume analyze 
    hackmyresume analyze resume.json
    hackmyresume analyze r1.json r2.json
    ```

- **convert** converts your source resume between FRESH and JSON Resume
formats. Use it to convert between the two formats to take advantage of tools
and services.

    ```bash
    # hackmyresume convert  TO 
    hackmyresume convert resume.json TO resume-jrs.json
    hackmyresume convert 1.json 2.json 3.json TO out/1.json out/2.json out/3.json
    ```

- **validate** validates the specified resume against either the FRESH or JSON
Resume schema. Use it to make sure your resume data is sufficient and complete.

    ```bash
    # hackmyresume validate 
    hackmyresume validate resume.json
    hackmyresume validate r1.json r2.json r3.json
    ```

- **peek** echoes your resume or any field, property, or object path on your
resume to standard output.

    ```bash
    # hackmyresume peek  [OBJECT-PATH]
    hackmyresume peek rez.json # Echo the whole resume
    hackmyresume peek rez.json info.brief # Echo the ""info.brief"" field
    hackmyresume peek rez.json employment.history[1] # Echo the 1st job
    hackmyresume peek rez.json rez2.json info.brief # Compare value
    ```    

## Supported Output Formats

HackMyResume supports these output formats:

Output Format | Ext | Notes
------------- | --- | -----
HTML | .html | A standard HTML 5 + CSS resume format that can be viewed in a browser, deployed to a website, etc.
Markdown | .md | A structured Markdown document that can be used as-is or used to generate HTML.
LaTeX | .tex | A structured LaTeX document (or collection of documents) that can be processed with pdflatex, xelatex, and similar tools.
MS Word | .doc | A Microsoft Word office document (XML-driven; WordProcessingML).
Adobe Acrobat (PDF) | .pdf | A binary PDF document driven by an HTML theme (through wkhtmltopdf).
plain text | .txt | A formatted plain text document appropriate for emails or copy-paste.
JSON | .json | A JSON representation of the resume.
YAML | .yml | A YAML representation of the resume.
RTF | .rtf | Forthcoming.
Textile | .textile | Forthcoming.
image | .png, .bmp | Forthcoming.

## Use

Assuming you've got a JSON-formatted resume handy, generating resumes in
different formats and combinations is easy. Just run:

```bash
hackmyresume build  to  [-t theme].
```

Where `` is one or more .json resume files, separated by spaces;
`` is one or more destination resumes, and `` is the desired
theme (default to Modern). For example:

```bash
# Generate all resume formats (HTML, PDF, DOC, TXT, YML, etc.)
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out/resume.all -t modern

# Generate a specific resume format
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out/resume.html
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out/resume.pdf
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out/resume.md
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out/resume.doc
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out/resume.json
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out/resume.txt
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out/resume.yml

# Specify 2 inputs and 3 outputs
hackmyresume build in1.json in2.json TO out.html out.doc out.pdf
```

You should see something to the effect of:

```
*** HackMyResume v1.4.0 ***
Reading JSON resume: foo/resume.json
Applying MODERN Theme (7 formats)
Generating HTML resume: out/resume.html
Generating TXT resume: out/resume.txt
Generating DOC resume: out/resume.doc
Generating PDF resume: out/resume.pdf
Generating JSON resume: out/resume.json
Generating MARKDOWN resume: out/resume.md
Generating YAML resume: out/resume.yml
```

## Advanced

### Applying a theme

HackMyResume can work with any FRESH or JSON Resume theme (the latter must be
installed first). To specify a theme when generating your resume, use the `-t`
or `--theme` parameter:

```bash
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out/rez.all -t [theme]
```

The `[theme]` parameter can be the name of a predefined theme OR the path to any
FRESH or JSON Resume theme folder:

```bash
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out/rez.all -t modern
hackmyresume build resume.json TO OUT.rez.all -t ../some-folder/my-custom-theme/
hackmyresume build resume.json TO OUT.rez.all -t node_modules/jsonresume-theme-classy
```

FRESH themes are currently pre-installed with HackMyResume. JSON Resume themes
can be installed prior to use:

```bash
# Install a JSON Resume theme into a local node_modules subfolder:
npm install jsonresume-theme-[name]
# Use it with HackMyResume
hackmyresume build resume.json -t node_modules/jsonresume-theme-[name]
```

As of v1.6.0, available predefined FRESH themes are `positive`, `modern`,
`compact`, `minimist`, and `hello-world`. For a list of JSON Resume themes,
check the [NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=jsonresume-theme).

### Merging resumes

You can **merge multiple resumes together** by specifying them in order from
most generic to most specific:

```bash
# Merge specific.json onto base.json and generate all formats
hackmyresume build base.json specific.json TO resume.all
```

This can be useful for overriding a base (generic) resume with information from
a specific (targeted) resume. For example, you might override your generic
catch-all ""software developer"" resume with specific details from your targeted
""game developer"" resume, or combine two partial resumes into a ""complete""
resume. Merging follows conventional [extend()][9]-style behavior and there's
no arbitrary limit to how many resumes you can merge:

```bash
hackmyresume build in1.json in2.json in3.json in4.json TO out.html out.doc
Reading JSON resume: in1.json
Reading JSON resume: in2.json
Reading JSON resume: in3.json
Reading JSON resume: in4.json
Merging in4.json onto in3.json onto in2.json onto in1.json
Generating HTML resume: out.html
Generating WORD resume: out.doc
```

### Multiple targets

You can specify **multiple output targets** and HackMyResume will build them:

```bash
# Generate out1.doc, out1.pdf, and foo.txt from me.json.
hackmyresume build me.json TO out1.doc out1.pdf foo.txt
```

### Using .all

The special `.all` extension tells HackMyResume to generate all supported output
formats for the given resume. For example, this...

```bash
# Generate all resume formats (HTML, PDF, DOC, TXT, etc.)
hackmyresume build me.json TO out/resume.all
```

..tells HackMyResume to read `me.json` and generate `out/resume.md`,
`out/resume.doc`, `out/resume.html`, `out/resume.txt`, `out/resume.pdf`, and
`out/resume.json`.

### Building PDFs

*Users who don't care about PDFs can turn off PDF generation across all themes
and formats with the `--pdf none` switch.*

HackMyResume takes a unique approach to PDF generation. Instead of enforcing
a specific PDF engine on users, HackMyResume will attempt to work with whatever
PDF engine you have installed through the engine's command-line interface (CLI).
Currently that means any of...

- [wkhtmltopdf][3]
- [Phantom.js][2]
- [WeasyPrint][11]

..with support for other engines planned in the future. But for now, **one or
more of these engines must be installed and accessible on your PATH in order
to generate PDF resumes with HackMyResume**. That means you should be able to
invoke either of these tools directly from your shell or terminal without error:

```bash
wkhtmltopdf input.html output.pdf
phantomjs script.js input.html output.pdf
weasyprint input.html output.pdf
```

Assuming you've installed one or both of these engines on your system, you can
tell HackMyResume which flavor of PDF generation to use via the `--pdf` option
(`-p` for short):

```bash
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out.all --pdf phantom
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out.all --pdf wkhtmltopdf
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out.all --pdf weasyprint
hackmyresume build resume.json TO out.all --pdf none
```

### Analyzing

HackMyResume can analyze your resume for keywords, employment gaps, and other
metrics. Run:

```bash
hackmyresume analyze .json
```

Depending on the HackMyResume version, you should see output similar to:


```

             TOTAL:   180 mentions
```

### Validating

HackMyResume can also validate your resumes against either the [FRESH /
FRESCA][fresca] or [JSON Resume][6] formats. To validate one or more existing
resumes, use the `validate` command:

```bash
# Validate myresume.json against either the FRESH or JSON Resume schema.
hackmyresume validate resumeA.json resumeB.json
```

HackMyResume will validate each specified resume in turn:

```bash
*** HackMyResume v1.6.0 ***
Validating JSON resume: resumeA.json (INVALID)
Validating JSON resume: resumeB.json (VALID)
```

### Converting

HackMyResume can convert between the [FRESH][fresca] and [JSON Resume][6]
formats. Just run:

```bash
hackmyresume convert  
```

where  is one or more resumes in FRESH or JSON Resume format, and
 is a corresponding list of output file names. HackMyResume will
autodetect the format (FRESH or JRS) of each input resume and convert it to the
other format (JRS or FRESH).

### File-based Options

You can pass options into HackMyResume via an external options or "".hackmyrc""
file with the `--options` or `-o` switch:

```bash
hackmyresume build resume.json -o path/to/options.json
```

The options file can contain any documented HackMyResume option, including
`theme`, `silent`, `debug`, `pdf`, `css`, and other settings.

```json
{
  ""theme"": ""compact"",

  ""sectionTitles"": {
    ""employment"": ""Work""
  },

  ""wkhtmltopdf"": {
    ""margin-top"": ""20mm""
  }
}
```

If an option is specified on both the command line and in an external options
file, the command-line option wins.

```bash
# path/to/options.json specifes the POSITIVE theme
# -t parameter specifies the COMPACT theme
# The -t parameter wins.
hackmyresume build resume.json -o path/to/options.json -t compact
> Reading resume: resume.json
> Applying COMPACT theme (7 formats)
```

### Prettifying

HackMyResume applies [js-beautify][10]-style HTML prettification by default to
HTML-formatted resumes. To disable prettification, the `--no-prettify` or `-n`
flag can be used:

```bash
hackmyresume build resume.json out.all --no-prettify
```

### Silent Mode

Use `-s` or `--silent` to run in silent mode:

```bash
hackmyresume build resume.json -o someFile.all -s
hackmyresume build resume.json -o someFile.all --silent
```

### Debug Mode

Use `-d` or `--debug` to force HMR to emit a call stack when errors occur. In
the future, this option will emit detailed error logging.

```bash
hackmyresume build resume.json -d
hackmyresume analyze resume.json --debug
```

### Disable Encoding

Use the `--no-escape` option to disable encoding in Handlebars themes. Note:
this option has no effect for non-Handlebars themes.

```bash
hackmyresume build resume.json --no-escape
```

### Private Resume Fields

Have a gig, education stint, membership, or other relevant history that you'd
like to hide from *most* (e.g. public) resumes but sometimes show on others? Tag it with
`""private"": true` to omit it from outbound generated resumes by default.


```json
""employment"": {
  ""history"": [
    {
      ""employer"": ""Acme Real Estate""
    },
    {
      ""employer"": ""Area 51 Alien Research Laboratory"",
      ""private"": true
    },
    {
      ""employer"": ""H&R Block""
    }
  ]
}
```

Then, when you want a copy of your resume that includes the private gig / stint
/ etc., tell HackMyResume that it's OK to emit private fields. The way you do
that is with the `--private` switch.

```bash
hackmyresume build resume.json private-resume.all --private
```


### Custom theme helpers

You can attach your own custom Handlebars helpers to a FRESH theme with the
`helpers` key of your theme's `theme.json` file.

```js
{
  ""title"": ""my-cool-theme"",

  // ...

  ""helpers"": [
    ""../path/to/helpers/*.js"",
    ""some-other-helper.js""
  ]

# Features:
- Mapping JSON to objects
- Mapping objects to JSON
- Nested Objects (stand alone, in arrays or in dictionaries)
- Custom transformations during mapping
- Struct support
- [Immutable support](#immutablemappable-protocol)

# The Basics
To support mapping, a class or struct just needs to implement the ```Mappable``` protocol which includes the following functions:
```swift
init?(map: Map)
mutating func mapping(map: Map)
```
ObjectMapper uses the ```<-``` operator to define how each member variable maps to and from JSON.

```swift
class User: Mappable {
    var username: String?
    var age: Int?
    var weight: Double!
    var array: [Any]?
    var dictionary: [String : Any] = [:]
    var bestFriend: User?                       // Nested User object
    var friends: [User]?                        // Array of Users
    var birthday: Date?

    required init?(map: Map) {

    }

    // Mappable
    func mapping(map: Map) {
        username    <- map[""username""]
        age         <- map[""age""]
        weight      <- map[""weight""]
        array       <- map[""arr""]
        dictionary  <- map[""dict""]
        bestFriend  <- map[""best_friend""]
        friends     <- map[""friends""]
        birthday    <- (map[""birthday""], DateTransform())
    }
}

struct Temperature: Mappable {
    var celsius: Double?
    var fahrenheit: Double?

    init?(map: Map) {

    }

    mutating func mapping(map: Map) {
        celsius 	<- map[""celsius""]
        fahrenheit 	<- map[""fahrenheit""]
    }
}
```

Once your class implements `Mappable`, ObjectMapper allows you to easily convert to and from JSON. 

Convert a JSON string to a model object:
```swift
let user = User(JSONString: JSONString)
```

Convert a model object to a JSON string:
```swift
let JSONString = user.toJSONString(prettyPrint: true)
```

Alternatively, the `Mapper.swift` class can also be used to accomplish the above (it also provides extra functionality for other situations):
```swift
// Convert JSON String to Model
let user = Mapper().map(JSONString: JSONString)
// Create JSON String from Model
let JSONString = Mapper().toJSONString(user, prettyPrint: true)
```

ObjectMapper can map classes composed of the following types:
- `Int`
- `Bool`
- `Double`
- `Float`
- `String`
- `RawRepresentable` (Enums)
- `Array`
- `Dictionary`
- `Object`
- `Array`
- `Array>`
- `Set` 
- `Dictionary`
- `Dictionary>`
- Optionals of all the above
- Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals of the above

## `Mappable` Protocol

#### `mutating func mapping(map: Map)` 
This function is where all mapping definitions should go. When parsing JSON, this function is executed after successful object creation. When generating JSON, it is the only function that is called on the object.

#### `init?(map: Map)` 
This failable initializer is used by ObjectMapper for object creation. It can be used by developers to validate JSON prior to object serialization. Returning nil within the function will prevent the mapping from occuring. You can inspect the JSON stored within the `Map` object to do your validation:
```swift
required init?(map: Map){
	// check if a required ""name"" property exists within the JSON.
	if map.JSON[""name""] == nil {
		return nil
	}
}
```

## `StaticMappable` Protocol
`StaticMappable` is an alternative to `Mappable`. It provides developers with a static function that is used by ObjectMapper for object initialization instead of `init?(map: Map)`. 

Note: `StaticMappable`, like `Mappable`, is a sub protocol of `BaseMappable` which is where the `mapping(map: Map)` function is defined.

#### `static func objectForMapping(map: Map) -> BaseMappable?` 
ObjectMapper uses this function to get objects to use for mapping. Developers should return an instance of an object that conforms to `BaseMappable` in this function. This function can also be used to:
- validate JSON prior to object serialization
- provide an existing cached object to be used for mapping
- return an object of another type (which also conforms to `BaseMappable`) to be used for mapping. For instance, you may inspect the JSON to infer the type of object that should be used for mapping ([see examples in ClassClusterTests.swift](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper/blob/master/Tests/ObjectMapperTests/ClassClusterTests.swift#L67))

If you need to implement ObjectMapper in an extension, you will need to adopt this protocol instead of `Mappable`. 

## `ImmutableMappable` Protocol

`ImmutableMappable` provides the ability to map immutable properties. This is how `ImmutableMappable` differs from `Mappable`:



ImmutableMappable
Mappable


Properties




let id: Int
let name: String?




var id: Int!
var name: String?




JSON -> Model




init(map: Map) throws {
  id   = try map.value(""id"")
  name = try? map.value(""name"")
}




mutating func mapping(map: Map) {
  id   <- map[""id""]
  name <- map[""name""]
}




Model -> JSON




func mapping(map: Map) {
  id   >>> map[""id""]
  name >>> map[""name""]
}




mutating func mapping(map: Map) {
  id   <- map[""id""]
  name <- map[""name""]
}




Initializing




try User(JSONString: JSONString)




User(JSONString: JSONString)





#### `init(map: Map) throws`

This throwable initializer is used to map immutable properties from the given `Map`. Every immutable property should be initialized in this initializer.

This initializer throws an error when:
- `Map` fails to get a value for the given key
- `Map` fails to transform a value using `Transform`

`ImmutableMappable` uses `Map.value(_:using:)` method to get values from the `Map`. This method should be used with the `try` keyword as it is throwable. `Optional` properties can easily be handled using `try?`.

```swift
init(map: Map) throws {
    name      = try map.value(""name"") // throws an error when it fails
    createdAt = try map.value(""createdAt"", using: DateTransform()) // throws an error when it fails
    updatedAt = try? map.value(""updatedAt"", using: DateTransform()) // optional
    posts     = (try? map.value(""posts"")) ?? [] // optional + default value
    surname    = try? map.value(""surname"", default: ""DefaultSurname"") // optional + default value as an argument
}
```

#### `mutating func mapping(map: Map)`

This method is where the reverse transform is performed (model to JSON). Since immutable properties cannot be mapped with the `<-` operator, developers have to define the reverse transform using the `>>>` operator.

```swift
mutating func mapping(map: Map) {
    name      >>> map[""name""]
    createdAt >>> (map[""createdAt""], DateTransform())
    updatedAt >>> (map[""updatedAt""], DateTransform())
    posts     >>> map[""posts""]
}
```

# Easy Mapping of Nested Objects
ObjectMapper supports dot notation within keys for easy mapping of nested objects. Given the following JSON String:
```json
""distance"" : {
     ""text"" : ""102 ft"",
     ""value"" : 31
}
```
You can access the nested objects as follows:
```swift
func mapping(map: Map) {
    distance <- map[""distance.value""]
}
```
Nested keys also support accessing values from an array. Given a JSON response with an array of distances, the value could be accessed as follows:
```swift
distance <- map[""distances.0.value""]
```
If you have a key that contains `.`, you can individually disable the above feature as follows:
```swift
func mapping(map: Map) {
    identifier <- map[""app.identifier"", nested: false]
}
```
When you have nested keys which contain `.`, you can pass the custom nested key delimiter as follows ([#629](https://github.com/tristanhimmelman/ObjectMapper/pull/629)):
```swift
func mapping(map: Map) {
    appName <- map[""com.myapp.info->com.myapp.name"", delimiter: ""->""]
}
```

# Custom Transforms
ObjectMapper also supports custom transforms that convert values during the mapping process. To use a transform, simply create a tuple with `map[""field_name""]` and the transform of your choice on the right side of the `<-` operator:
```swift
birthday <- (map[""birthday""], DateTransform())
```
The above transform will convert the JSON Int value to an Date when reading JSON and will convert the Date to an Int when converting objects to JSON.

You can easily create your own custom transforms by adopting and implementing the methods in the `TransformType` protocol:
```swift
public protocol TransformType {
    associatedtype Object
    associatedtype JSON

    func transformFromJSON(_ value: Any?) -> Object?
    func transformToJSON(_ value: Object?) -> JSON?
}
```

### TransformOf
In a lot of situations you can use the built-in transform class `TransformOf` to quickly perform a desired transformation. `TransformOf` is initialized with two types and two closures. The types define what the transform is converting to and from and the closures perform the actual transformation. 

For example, if you want to transform a JSON `String` value to an `Int` you could use `TransformOf` as follows:
```swift
let transform = TransformOf(fromJSON: { (value: String?) -> Int? in 
    // transform value from String? to Int?
    return Int(value!)
}, toJSON: { (value: Int?) -> String? in
    // transform value from Int? to String?
    if let value = value {
        return String(value)
    }
    return nil
})

id <- (map[""id""], transform)
```
Here is a more condensed version of the above:
```swift
id <- (map[""id""], TransformOf(fromJSON: { Int($0!) }, toJSON: { $0.map { String($0) } }))
```

# Subclasses

Classes that implement the `Mappable` protocol can easily be subclassed. When subclassing mappable classes, follow the structure below:

```swift
class Base: Mappable {
    var base: String?
    
    required init?(map: Map) {

    }

    func mapping(map: Map) {
        base <- map[""base""]
    }
}

class Subclass: Base {
    var sub: String?

    required init?(map: Map) {
        super.init(map)
    }

    override func mapping(map: Map) {
        super.mapping(map)
        
        sub <- map[""sub""]
    }
}
```

Make sure your subclass implementation calls the right initializers and mapping functions to also apply the mappings from your superclass.

# Generic Objects

ObjectMapper can handle classes with generic types as long as the generic type also conforms to `Mappable`. See the following example:
```swift
class Result: Mappable {
    var result: T?

    required init?(map: Map){

    }

    func mapping(map: Map) {
        result <- map[""result""]
    }
}

let result = Mapper>().map(JSON)
```

# Mapping Context

The `Map` object which is passed around during mapping, has an optional `MapContext` object that is available for developers to use if they need to pass information around during mapping. 

To take advantage of this feature, simply create an object that implements `MapContext` (which is an empty protocol) and pass it into `Mapper` during initialization. 
```swift
struct Context: MapContext {
	var importantMappingInfo = ""Info that I need during mapping""
}

class User: Mappable {
	var name: String?
	
	required init?(map: Map){
	
	}
	
	func mapping(map: Map){
		if let context = map.context as? Context {
			// use context to make decisions about mapping
		}
	}
}

let context = Context()
let user = Mapper(context: context).map(JSONString)
```

# ObjectMapper + Alamofire

If you are using [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for networking and you want to convert your responses to  objects, you can use [AlamofireObjectMapper](https://github.com/tristanhimmelman/AlamofireObjectMapper). It is a simple Alamofire extension that uses ObjectMapper to automatically map JSON response data to  objects.


# ObjectMapper + Realm

ObjectMapper and Realm can be used together. Simply follow the class structure below and you will be able to use ObjectMapper to generate your Realm models:

```swift
class Model: Object, Mappable {
    dynamic var name = """"

    required convenience init?(map: Map) {
        self.init()
    }

    func mapping(map: Map) {
        name <- map[""name""]
    }
}
```

If you want to serialize associated RealmObjects, you can use [ObjectMapper+Realm](https://github.com/jakenberg/ObjectMapper-Realm). It is a simple Realm extension that serializes arbitrary JSON into Realm's `List` class.

To serialize  `String`, `Int`, `Double` and `Bool` arrays you can use [ObjectMapperAdditions/Realm](https://github.com/APUtils/ObjectMapperAdditions#realm-features). It'll wrap  types into RealmValues that can be stored in Realm's `List` class.

Note: Generating a JSON string of a Realm Object using ObjectMappers' `toJSON` function only works within a Realm write transaction. This is because ObjectMapper uses the `inout` flag in its mapping functions (`<-`) which are used both for serializing and deserializing. Realm detects the flag and forces the `toJSON` function to be called within a write block even though the objects are not being modified.

***Welcome to Itsy Bitsy Data Structures!***

In here are super simplified examples of many of the common data structures
written in easy to read .

Reading through the guided code will help you learn about what data structures
are, what their uses are, and how to discuss them.

### [Want to jump into the code? Click here](itsy-bitsy-data-structures.js)

Also be sure to check out my other code walkthrough:
[The Super Tiny Compiler](https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler)

---

### Why should I care?

Data Structures might not be the juiciest topic in the world, but they are
hugely important to growing as an engineer. Knowing data structures don't just
make your programs faster and more efficient, but they help you organize your
code and your thoughts so that you can build more complicated programs without
a ton of mental overhead.

### But data structures are scary!

Yeah, lots of computer science topics are intimidating, and that's largely a
fault of how they are taught. In this we're going to do a high level pass over
a lot of the key things you need to know in order to dive into them deeper.
It's more about introducing you to the shared language of data structures.

### Okay so where do I begin?

Awesome! Head on over to the
[itsy-bitsy-data-structures.js](itsy-bitsy-data-structures.js) file.

### I'm back, that didn't make sense

Ouch, I'm really sorry. I'm planning on doing a lot more work on this to add
inline annotations. If you want to come back when that's done, you can either
watch/star this repo or follow me on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/thejameskyle) for updates.

luruke/browser-2020,,"It's 2020, and browsers can do amazing stuff.  

This repo contains a non-exhaustive list of less-known features implemented in browsers **today**.

This list isn't intended for a technical audience; instead it wants to be a ""I didn't know we could do that in a browser!"" list.

WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED
====================================
It will not receive any future updates or bug fixes. If you are using it, please migrate to another solution.
***************


Purpose
--------------

FXForms is an  library for easily creating table-based forms on iOS. It is ideal for settings pages or data-entry tasks.

Unlike other solutions, FXForms works directly with strongly-typed data models that you supply (instead of dictionaries or complicated dataSource protocols), and infers as much information as possible from your models using introspection, to avoid the need for tedious duplication of type information.

![Screenshot of BasicExample](https://raw.github.com/nicklockwood/FXForms/1.2.3/Examples/BasicExample/Screenshot.png)

Supported iOS & SDK Versions
-----------------------------

* Supported build target - iOS 9.0 (Xcode 7.0, Apple LLVM compiler 7.0)
* Earliest supported deployment target - iOS 7.0
* Earliest compatible deployment target - iOS 5.0

NOTE: 'Supported' means that the library has been tested with this version. 'Compatible' means that the library should work on this iOS version (i.e. it doesn't rely on any unavailable SDK features) but is no longer being tested for compatibility and may require tweaking or bug fixes to run correctly.


ARC Compatibility
------------------

FXForms requires ARC. If you wish to use FXForms in a non-ARC project, just add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to the `FXForms.m` class. To do this, go to the Build Phases tab in your target settings, open the Compile Sources group, double-click `FXForms.m` in the list and type `-fobjc-arc` into the popover.

If you wish to convert your whole project to ARC, comment out the #error line in `FXForms.m`, then run the Edit > Refactor > Convert to  ARC... tool in Xcode and make sure all files that you wish to use ARC for (including `FXForms.m`) are checked.


Creating a form
------------------

To create a form object, just make any new `NSObject` subclass that conforms to the `FXForm` protocol, like this:

```objc
@interface MyForm : NSObject 

@end
```

The `FXForm` protocol has no compulsory methods or properties. The FXForms library will inspect your object and identify all public and private properties and use them to generate the form. For example, suppose you wanted to have a form containing an ""Email"" and ""Password"" field,  and a ""Remember Me"" switch; you would define it like this:

```objc
@interface MyForm : NSObject 

@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *email;
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *password;
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL rememberMe;

@end
```

That's literally all you have to do. FXForms is *really* smart; much more so than you might expect:

* Fields will appear in the same order you declare them in your class
* Fields will automatically be assigned suitable control types, for example, the rememberMe field will be displayed as a `UISwitch`, the email field will automatically have a keyboard of type `UIKeyboardTypeEmailAddress` and the password field will automatically have `secureTextEntry` enabled. 
* Field titles are based on the key name, but camelCase is automatically converted to a Title Case, with intelligent handling of ACRONYMS, etc.
* Modifying values in the form will automatically assign those values back to your model object. You can use custom setter methods and/or KVO to intercept the changes if you need to perform additional logic.
* If your form contains subforms (properties that conform to the `FXForm` protocol), or view controllers (e.g for terms and conditions pages), they will automatically be instantiated if they are nil - no need to set default values.

These default behaviors are all inferred by inspecting the property type and name using 's runtime API, but they can also all be overridden if you wish - that's covered later under Tweaking form behavior


Displaying a form (basic)
----------------------------

To display your form in a view controller, you have two options: `FXForms` provides a `UIViewController` subclass called `FXFormViewController` that is designed to make getting started as simple as possible. To set up `FXFormViewController`, just create it as normal and set your form as follows:

```objc
FXFormViewController *controller = [[FXFormViewController alloc] init];
controller.formController.form = [[MyForm alloc] init];
```

You can then display the form controller just as you would do any ordinary view controller. `FXFormViewController` contains a `UITableView`, which it will create automatically as needed. If you prefer however, you can assign your own `UITableView` to the `tableView` property and use that instead. You can even initialize the `FXFormViewController` with a nib file that creates the tableView.

`FXFormViewController` is designed to be subclassed, just like a regular `UIViewController` or `UITableViewController`. In most cases, you'll want to subclass `FXFormViewController` so you can add your form setup logic and action handlers. 

It is a good idea to place the `FXFormViewController` (or subclass) inside a `UINavigationController`. This is not mandatory, but if the form contains subforms, these will be pushed onto its navigationController, and if that does not exist, the forms will not be displayed.

Like `UITableViewController`, `FXFormViewController` will normally assign the tableView as the main view of the controller. Unlike `UITableViewController`, it doesn't *have* to be - you can make your tableView a subview of your main view if you prefer.

Like `UITableViewController`, `FXFormViewController` implements the `UITableViewDelegate` protocol, so if you subclass it, you can override the `UITableViewDelegate` and `UIScrollViewDelegate` methods to implement custom behaviors. `FXFormViewController` is not actually the direct delegate of the tableView however, it is the delegate of its formController, which is an instance of `FXFormController`. The formController acts as the tableView's delegate and datasource, and proxies the `UITableViewDelegate` methods back to the `FXFormViewController` via the `FXFormControllerDelegate` protocol.

Unlike `UITableViewController`, `FXFormViewController` does not implement `UITableViewDataSource` protocol. This is handled entirely by the `FXFormController`, and it is not recommended that you try to override or intercept any of the datasource methods.


Displaying a form (advanced)
----------------------------

The `FXFormViewController` is pretty flexible, but sometimes it's inconvenient to be forced to use a particular base controller class. For example, you may wish to use a common base class for all your view controllers, or display a form inside a view that does not have an associated controller.

In the former case, you could add an `FXFormViewController` as a child controller, but in the latter case that wouldn't work. To use FXForms without using `FXFormViewController`, you can use the `FXFormController` directly. To display a form using `FXFormController`, you just need to set the form and tableView properties, and it will do the rest. You can optionally bind the `FXFormController`'s delegate property to be notified of `UITableView` events.

When using a custom form view controller in this way, some interactions are still handled for you (e.g. adjusting the table view content inset when the keyboard is presented), but you will need to add other view logic yourself, such as reloading the table when the `UIViewController` appears on screen.

Here is example code for a custom form view controller:

```objc
@interface MyFormViewController : UIViewController 

@property (nonatomic, strong) IBOutlet UITableView *tableView;
@property (nonatomic, strong) FXFormController *formController;

@end

@implementation MyFormViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    
    //we'll assume that tableView has already been set via a nib or the -loadView method
    self.formController = [[FXFormController alloc] init];
    self.formController.tableView = self.tableView;
    self.formController.delegate = self;
    self.formController.form = [[MyForm alloc] init];
}

- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated
{
    [super viewWillAppear:animated];
    
    //reload the table
    [self.tableView reloadData];
}

@end
```


Tweaking form behavior
------------------------

FXForm's greatest strength is that it eliminates work by guessing as much as possible. It can't guess everything however, and it sometimes guesses wrong. So how do you correct it?

You may find that you don't want all of your object properties to become form fields; you may have private properties that are used internally by your form model for example, or you may just wish to order the fields differently to how you've arranged your properties in the interface.

To override the list of form fields, implement the optional `-fields` method of your form:

```objc
- (NSArray *)fields
{
    return @[@""field1"", @""field2"", @""field3""];
}
```

The fields method should return an array of strings, dictionaries, or a mixture. In the example we have returned strings; these map to the names of properties of the form object. If you return an array of names like this, these fields will replace the automatically generated field list.

The `-fields` method will be called again every time the form is reassigned to the formController. That means that you can generate the fields dynamically, based on application logic. For example, you could show or hide certain fields based on other properties.

In addition to omitting and rearranging fields, you may wish to override their attributes. There are two ways to do this: One way is to add a method to the form object, such as `-(NSDictionary *)[name]Field;` where name is the property that the field relates to. This method returns a dictionary of properties that you wish to override (see Form field properties, below). For example, if we wanted to override the title of the email field, we could do it like this:

```objc
- (NSDictionary *)emailField
{
    return @{FXFormFieldTitle: @""Email Address""};
}
```

Alternatively, you can return a dictionary in the `-fields` array instead of a string. If you do this, you must include the `FXFormFieldKey` so that FXForms knows which field you are overriding:

```objc
- (NSArray *)fields
{
    return @[
             @{FXFormFieldKey: @""email"", FXFormFieldTitle: @""Email Address""},
             ...other fields...
            ];
}
```

These two approaches are equivalent.

You may wish to add additional, virtual form fields (e.g. buttons or labels) that don't correspond to any properties on your form class. You can do this by implementing the `-fields` method, but if you're happy with the default fields and just want to add some extra fields at the end, you can override the `-extraFields` method instead, which works the same way, but leaves in place the default fields inferred from the form class:

```objc
- (NSArray *)extraFields
{
    return @[
             @{FXFormFieldTitle: @""Extra Field""},
            ];
}
```

Similarly, if you only want to display a subset of the form object's properties in your form, but don't want to have to list all the properties you want to keep in the `-fields` method just for the sake of excluding a few of them, you can use the `-excludedFields` method to specify just the names of properties you *don't* want to include.

```objc
- (NSArray *)excludedFields
{
    return @[
             @""someProperty"",
             @""someOtherProperty"",
            ];
}
```


Grouping fields
---------------------

You may wish to group your form fields into sections in the form to make it ease to use. FXForms handles grouping in a very simple way - you just add an `FXFormFieldHeader` or `FXFormFieldFooter` attribute to any field and it will start/end the section at that point. The `FXFormFieldHeader/Footer` can be either a string that will be displayed as the header or footer text for the section, or a custom UIView instance or subclass. If you don't want a header or footer, just supply an empty string or `NSNull` value.

In the following example, we have four fields, and we've split them into two groups, each with a header:

```objc
- (NSArray *)fields
{
    return @[
             @{FXFormFieldKey: @""field1"", FXFormFieldHeader: @""Section 1""},
             @""field2"",
             @{FXFormFieldKey: @""field3"", FXFormFieldHeader: @""Section 2""},
             @""field4"",
            ];
}
```

Alternatively, since we aren't overriding any other field properties, we could have done this more cleanly by using the following approach:

```objc
- (NSDictionary *)field1Field
{
    return @{FXFormFieldHeader: @""Section 1""};
}

- (NSDictionary *)field3Field
{
    return @{FXFormFieldHeader: @""Section 2""};
}
```


Form field properties
------------------------

The list of form field properties that you can set are as follows. Most of these have sensible defaults set automatically. Note that the string values of these constants are declared in the interface - you can assume that the string values of these constants will no change in future releases, and you can safely use these values in (for example) a plist used to configure the form.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldKey = @""key"";
```
    
This is the name of the related property of the form object. If your field isn't backed by a real property, this might be the name of a getter method used to populate the field value. It's also possible to have completely virtual fields (such as buttons) that do not have a key at all.
    
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldType = @""type"";
```
    
This is the field type, which is used to decide how the field will be displayed in the table. The type is used to determine which type of cell to use to represent the field, but it may also be used to configure the cell (a single cell class may support multiple field types). The type is automatically inferred from the field property declaration, but can be overridden. Supported types are listed under Form field types below, however you can supply any string as the type and implement a custom form cell to display and/or edit it.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldClass = @""class"";
```

This is the class of the field value. For primitive types, this will be the class used to box the value when accessed via KVC (e.g. `NSNumber` for numeric values, or `NSValue` for `struct` types). This is automatically determined for all properties of the form, so you rarely need to set it yourself. For form properties that you add yourself using the `-fields` or `-extraFields` methods, it is sometimes helpful to specify this explicitly. A good example would be if you are adding view controller or subform fields, where the class cannot usually be inferred automatically. The value provided can be either a `Class` object or a string representing the class name.


```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldCell = @""cell"";
```

This is the class of the cell used to represent the field. By default this value is not specified on the field-level; instead, the `FXFormController` maintains a map of fields types to cell classes, which allows you to override the default cells used to display a given field type on a per-form level rather than having to do it per-field. If you *do* need to provide a special one-off cell type, you can use this property to do so. The value provided can be either a `Class` object or a string representing the class name.
    
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTitle = @""title"";
```
    
This is the display title for the field. This is automatically generated from the key by converting from camelCase to Title Case, and then localised by running it through the `NSLocalizedString()` macro. That means that instead of overriding the title using this key, you can do so in your strings file instead if you prefer.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldPlaceholder = @""placeholder"";
```

This is the placeholder value to display when the field value is nil or empty. This is typically a string, but doesn't have to be, for example it could be an NSDate for a date field, or a UIImage for an image field. When used with an options or multi-select field, the placeholder will appear as the first item in the options list, and can be used to reset the field to nil / no value.
    
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldDefaultValue = @""default"";
```

This is a default value to use when the field value is nil. This can be useful when creating forms dynamically as the default values can be set directly in the fields array instead of separately in the form's values. It's also a way to ensure that a field value can never be set to nil by the user. Note that the default value is different from the placeholder value, as it will actually be stored in the form itself. If a default value is set, the placeholder will never appear. Default values only work reliably for object types - since zero is potentially a meaningful value for an integer or float property, it will not be replaced by the default value.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldOptions = @""options"";
```
    
For any field type, you can supply an array of supported values, which will override the standard field with a checklist of options to be selected instead. The options can be NSStrings, NSNumbers or any other object type. You can supply an `FXFormFieldValueTransformer` to control how the option values are displayed in the list. Alternatively, if you use a custom object for the values, you can implement the `-(NSString *)fieldDescription;` method to control how it is displayed. See Form field options below for more details.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTemplate = @""template"";
```

If the field is an NSArray or NSOrderedSet, FXForms allows the user to add, edit and remove items. By default FXForms assumes that the values in the collection are of type FXFormFieldTypeText, however you can override this using the FXFormFieldTemplate dictionary. The FXFormFieldTemplate dictionary can contains most of the same types of value as an ordinary field dictionary, and should be used to describe all the attributes of the elements in the collection.


```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldValueTransformer = @""valueTransformer"";
```

Sometimes the value you wish to display for a field may not match the value you store. For example, you might want to display a date in a  particular format, or convert a locale code into its human-readable equivalent. The `FXFormFieldValueTransformer` property lets you specify either a conversion block or an `NSValueTransformer` to use for converting the field value to a string. If a value transformer is provided, it will be used instead of calling the `-fieldDescription` method of the field's value object. You can supply either an instance of `NSValueTransformer` or the name of an `NSValueTransformer` subclass. If the form field has an options array, the value transformer will also be used to control how the options are displayed in the list. The `FXFormFieldValueTransformer` can be reversible, in which case it will be also be used to convert input values before storing them in the form.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldAction = @""action"";
```
    
This is an optional action to be performed by the field. The value can be either a string representing the name of a selector, or a block, and will be executed when the field is activated. If the action is specified as a selector, the target is determined by cascading up the responder chain from the cell until an object is encountered that responds to it. That means that you could choose to implement this action method on the tableview, its superview, the view controller, the app delegate, or even the window. If your form is presented as a subform of another form, you can also implement actions methods for subforms in the view controller for their parent form.

For non-interactive fields, the action will be called when the cell is selected; for fields such as switches or textfields, it will fire when the value is changed. When using a selector, the action method can accept either zero or one argument. The argument supplied will be the sender, which is typically a form field cell, (a `UITableViewCell` conforming to the `FXFormFieldCell` protocol), from which you can access the field model, and from that the form itself.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldSegue = @""segue"";
```
    
This is a `UIStoryboardSegue` to be performed when the field is tapped. This can be either be a `UIStoryboardSegue` subclass (or a string containing the name of a `UIStoryboardSegue` subclass), an instance of a `UIStoryboardSegue` subclass, or a string representing the identifier of a segue attached to the form view controller. Note that in the latter case, the segue *must* be attached to the same controller as the form, or it will crash when invoked.

If the FXFormFieldSegue property is a segue instance or identifier, it will be invoked when the field is tapped. If it is a segue subclass, this segue will be instantiated and used to handle the transition when displaying a subform or sub-controller.


```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldHeader = @""header"";
```
    
This property provides an optional section header to display before the field. The value can be either a string or a UIView instance or subclass (or a string containing the name of a UIView subclass). The height of the header will be inferred from the view, or you can override it using the UITableViewDelegate. By default, its value will be inferred automatically for subforms based on the name of the subform property. Supply an empty string or `NSNull` value to create a section partition without a title.
    
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldFooter = @""footer"";
```
    
This property provides an optional section footer string to display after the field. The value can be either a string or a UIView instance or subclass (or a string containing the name of a UIView subclass). The height of the footer will be inferred from the view, or you can override it using the UITableViewDelegate. Supply an empty string or `NSNull` value to create a section partition without a footer, or just omit the `FXFormFieldFooter` key altogether.
    
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldInline = @""inline"";
```

Fields whose values is another FXForm, or which have a supplied options array, will normally be displayed in a new FXFormViewController, which is pushed onto the navigation stack when you tap the field. You may wish to display such fields inline within same tableView instead. You can do this by setting the `FXFormFieldInline` property to `@YES`.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldSortable = @""sortable"";
```

Fields of type NSArray or NSOrderedSet can optionally display sorting controls so that the user can change the item order. Set the FXFormFieldSortable property to YES to enabled this feature.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldViewController = @""controller"";
```

Some types of field may be displayed in another view controller, which will be pushed onto the navigation stack when the field is selected. By default this class is not specified on the field-level; instead, the `FXFormController` maintains a map of fields types to controller classes, which allows you to override the default controller used to display a given field type on a per-form level rather than having to do it per-field. If you *do* need to provide a special one-off controller type, the FXFormFieldViewController property lets you specify the controller to be used on a per-field basis. `FXFormViewController` can be either a `UIViewController` instance or class (or a string containing the name of a class). The controller specified must conform to the `FXFormFieldViewController` protocol. By default, such fields will be displayed using the `FXFormViewController` class.


Form field types
------------------------

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeDefault = @""default"";
```
    
This is the default field type, used if no specific type can be determined.
    
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeLabel = @""label"";
```
    
This type can be used if you want the field to be treated as non-interactive/read-only. Form values will be displayed by converting the value to a string using the `-fieldDescription` method. This maps to the standard `NSObject -description` method for all built-in types, but you can override it for your own custom value classes.
    
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeText = @""text"";
```
    
By default, this field type will be represented by an ordinary `UITextField` with default autocorrection.
    
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeLongText = @""longtext"";
```

This type represents multiline text. By default, this field type will be represented by an expanding `UITextView`.
    
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeURL = @""url"";
```
    
Like `FXFormFieldTypeText`, but with a keyboard type of `UIKeyboardTypeURL`, and no autocorrection.
    
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeEmail = @""email"";
```
    
Like `FXFormFieldTypeText`, but with a keyboard type of `UIKeyboardTypeEmailAddress`, and no autocorrection.
    
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypePassword = @""password"";
```
    
Like `FXFormFieldTypeText`, but with secure text entry enabled, and no autocorrection.
    
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeNumber = @""number"";
```
    
Like `FXFormFieldTypeText`, but with a numeric keyboard, and input restricted to a valid number.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeInteger = @""integer"";
```
    
Like `FXFormFieldTypeNumber`, but restricted to integer input.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeUnsigned = @""unsigned"";
```
 
Like `FXFormFieldTypeInteger`, but for unsigned values. Uses number pad by default.

 
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeFloat = @""float"";
```
    
Like `FXFormFieldTypeNumber`, but indicates value is primitive (not-nillable)
    
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeBoolean = @""boolean"";
```
    
A boolean value, set using a `UISwitch` control by default.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeOption = @""option"";
```

Like `FXFormFieldTypeBoolean`, but this type is used for toggle options and by default it creates a checkmark control instead of a switch.
    
```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeDate = @""date"";
```

A date value, selected using a `UIDatePicker`.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeTime = @""time"";
```

A time value, selected using a `UIDatePicker`.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeDateTime = @""datetime"";
```

A date and time, selected using a `UIDatePicker`.

```objc
static NSString *const FXFormFieldTypeImage = @""image""
```

An image, selected using a `UIImagePickerController`.


Form field options
----------------------

When you provide an options array for a form field, the field input will be presented as a list of options to tick. How this list of options is converted to the form value depends on the type of field:

If the field type matches the values in the options array, selecting the option will set the selected value directly, but that may not be what you want. For example, if you have a list of strings, you may be more interested in the selected index than the value (which may have been localised and formatted for human consumption, not machine interpretation). If the field type is numeric, and the options values are not numeric, it will be assumed that the field value should be set to the *index* of the selected item, instead of the value.

If the field is a collection type (such as NSArray, NSSet, etc.), the form will allow the user to select multiple options instead of one. Collections are handled as followed, depending on the class of the property: If you use `NSArray`, `NSSet` and `NSOrderedSet`, the selected values will be stored directly in the collection; If you use an `NSIndexSet`, the indexes of the values will be stored; If you use `NSDictionary`, both the values *and* their indexes will be stored. For ordered collection types, the order of the selected values is guaranteed to match the order in the options array.

Multi-select fields can also be used with `NS_OPTIONS`-style bitfield enum values. Just use an integer or enum as your property type, and then specify a field type of `FXFormFieldTypeBitfield`. You can then either specify explicit bit values in your options by using `NSNumber` values, or let FXForms infer the bit value from the option index.

*NOTE:* the actual values defined in your enum are not available to FXForms at runtime, so the selected values will be purely determined by the index of value of the options in the `FXFormFieldOptions` value. If your enum values are non-sequential, or do not begin at zero, the indices won't match the options indexes. To define enum options with non-sequential values, you can specify explicit numeric option values and use `FXFormFieldValueTransformer` to display human readable labels, like this:

```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, Gender)
{
    GenderMale = 10,
    GenderFemale = 15,
    GenderOther = -1
};

- (NSDictionary *)genderField
{
    return @{FXFormFieldOptions: @[@(GenderMale), @(GenderFemale), @(GenderOther)],
             FXFormFieldValueTransformer: ^(id input) {
             return @{@(GenderMale): @""Male"",
                      @(GenderFemale): @""Female"",
                      @(GenderOther): @""Other""}[input];
    }};
}
```


Cell configuration
-------------------

If you want to tweak some properties of the field cells, without subclassing them, you can actually set any cell property by keyPath, just by adding extra values to your field dictionary. For example, this code would turn the textLabel for the email field red:

```objc
- (NSDictionary *)emailField
{
    return @{@""textLabel.color"": [UIColor redColor]};
}
```

This code would disable auto-capitalisation for the name field:

```objc
- (NSDictionary *)nameField
{
    return @{@""textField.autocapitalizationType"": @(UITextAutocapitalizationTypeNone)};

Cells are not recycled in the FXForm controller, so you don't need to worry about cleaning up any properties that you set in this way. Be careful of overusing ""stringly typed"" code such as this however, as errors can't be caught at compile time. For heavy customisation, it is better to create cell subclasses and override properties in the `-setField:` method.
    

Custom cells
----------------

FXForms provides default cell implementations for all supported fields. You may wish to provide additional cell classes for custom field types, or even replace all of the FXForm cells with custom versions for your application.

There are two levels of customisation possible for cells. The simplest option is to subclass one of the existing `FXFormCell` classes, which all inherit from `FXFormBaseCell`. These cell classes contain a lot of logic for handling the various different field types, but also expose the views and controls used, for easy customisation.

When subclassing an existing cell type, you can override the `setUp`, `update` and `didSelectWithTableView:controller:` methods (optionally calling [super ...] if you want to inherit the original cell's behaviors). The `setUp` method will be called once when the cell is created, and the `update` method will be called each time the field value is updated.

If you already have a base cell class and don't want to base your cells on `FXFormBaseCell`, you can create an FXForms-compatible cell from scratch by subclassing `UITableViewCell` and adopting the `FXFormFieldCell` protocol.

Your custom cell must have a property called field, of type `FXFormField`. `FXFormField` is a wrapper class used to encapsulate the properties of a field, and also provides a way to set and get the associated form value (via the `field.value` virtual property). You cannot instantiate `FXFormField` objects directly, however they can be accessed and enumerated via methods on the `FXFormController`.

Once you have created your custom cell, you can use it as follows:

* If your cell is used only for a few specific fields, you can use the `FXFormFieldCell` property to use it for a particular form field
* If your cell is designed to handle a particular field type (or types), you can tell the formController to use your custom cell class for a particular type using the `-registerCellClass:forFieldType:` method of FXFormController.
* If your cell is designed to handle a particular field value class (or subclass), you can tell the formController to use your custom cell class for a particular value class using the `-registerCellClass:forFieldClass:` method of FXFormController.
* If you want to completely replace all cells with your own classes, use the `-registerDefaultFieldCellClass:` method of `FXFormController`. This replaces all default cell associations for all field types with your new cell class. You can then use `-registerCellClass:forFieldType:` to add additional cell classes for specific types.

 
Swift Compatibility
--------------------

FXForms is fully compatible with Swift, with the following caveats:

* Your forms objects must inherit from `NSObject`, or de declared using the `@objc` qualifier.
* For collection fields, you must use `NSArray`, `NSDictionary`, `NSOrderedSet`, etc. Swift's strongly typed collections won't work.
* If your form objects are declared in a different module to your main app, FXForm's field value class inference may not work correctly, in which case you can explicitly specify the field class by adding the following method to your form object for each field that doesn't work:

```swift
func fieldThatDoesntWorkField() -> NSDictionary {
    return [FXFormFieldClass: fieldThatDoesntWork.dynamicType]
}
```

Modern Script (`modern-cljs`) is a series of tutorials that
guide you in creating and running [Script][5] (CLJS) projects.

CLJS is a compiler for the  programming language that targets
JavaScript. It emits JavaScript code which runs in web browsers and
other client-side or server-side JavaScript interpreters
(e.g. [nodejs][6]).

## Required background

These tutorials require that you have some prior programming
experience.  They assume you've gotten your hands dirty by trying a
little , even if you're not proficient in it yet. It will also
be quite helpful if you have some experience programming for the Web
using HTML, JavaScript and the browser DOM.

If you don't know anything about  (or about Lisp), I recommend
you learn a little bit before starting these tutorials.

There are plenty of outstanding resources on  that are freely
available on the Internet, and you can't overestimate the benefit of
reading a book on  (or another Lisp dialect) to your value as a
programmer.

Here are some book recommendations:

* [ Programming][7]: written by three of the heroes of ,
  it contains everything you need to know about  and its
  ecosystem.
* [Programming ][8]: written by another legendary 
  developer, it's the easiest path to learning .
* [The Joy of ][9]: the title speaks by itself. A must read!
* [Script Rationale][41] and [Script Quick Start][42]
* [Script Up and Running][10]: at the moment, it's the only
  published book on Script. The book is a bit outdated since
  Script is evolving quickly. It's brief and useful, especially
  if you want to integrate with external JavaScript libraries.
* [SICP - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][11]: this
  is the best programming book I've read in my very long career. It
  uses [Scheme/Racket][12] (a Lisp dialect) rather than  and is
  available [online][13], in [print][13], or in a
  [lecture series][14].
* [On Lisp][15]: if you want to learn about macros, this is the place
  to start.  It uses Common Lisp (a Lisp dialect) rather than .

## Required tools

Many people worry about which operating system and editor/IDE are best
for developing in  and Script. I personally use Mac OS
X, Debian and Ubuntu. I use Emacs as an editor.

Because I'm an old-timer, [*nix][43] and Emacs are the OS and editor I know best.
That being said, in this series of tutorials you're not going to find any
suggestions or reference to operating systems or editors. Use whatever tools
you already have and know. I have too much respect for people developing
IDE/plugins for /CLJS to say that one is better than another, and
you don't want to combine learning a new programming language with trying
to learn a new programming environment.

> NOTE: If you are interested in learning more about Emacs here are some
[resources to help get you started]
(https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs/blob/master/doc/supplemental-material/emacs-cider-references.md).

You will need to have [git][16] and [Java][34] installed and you'll
need some familiarity with the [basics of git][17].

##  community documentation

Community created clojure documentation sites that you may find helpful are
[clojuredocs](http://clojuredocs.org/) and [Grimoire](https://www.conj.io/).

## Libraries and tools

[ Toolbox](http://www.clojure-toolbox.com/) is a directory of
libraries and tools for CLJ/CLJS.

## Why the name Modern Script?

You might wonder why this tutorial series is named `modern-cljs` when
Script is so recent. I started this series in 2012 while trying
to port a few examples from the
[Modern JavaScript: Develop and Design][18] book to Script, and
now it's too late to change.

# The Tutorials

As said, this is the [second edition][1] of the series and is based on
the [Boot][3] build tool. I'm not going to update or support the
[first edition][2] of the series which was based on the [Leiningen][4]
build tool.

## Introduction

This series of tutorials guides you in creating and running simple CLJS
projects. The bulk of the series follows the progressive enhancement of
a single project.

While working through the tutorials I *strongly* suggest you start at
tutorial 1 and type in all the code for each tutorial yourself.
In my experience this is the the best approach if you're not already
very fluent with the programming language.

## [Tutorial 1 - The Basics][19]

Create and configure a very basic CLJS project.

## [Tutorial 2 - Immediate Feedback Principle][20]

Approach as close as possible the Bret Victor Immediate Feedback
Principle to build a very interactive development environment.

## [Tutorial 3 - House Keeping][21]

Automate the launching of the `boot` command to approach the Immediate
Feedback Development Environment (IFDE).

## [Tutorial 4 - Modern Script][22]

Have some fun with CLJS form validation by porting the JavaScript login form
example from [Modern JavaScript: Develop and Design][18] to CLJS.

## [Tutorial 5 - Introducing Domina][23]

Use the [Domina library][24] to make our login form validation more -ish.

## [Tutorial 6 - The Easy Made Complex, and the Simple Made Easy][25]

Investigate and find two different ways to solve an issue from the last
tutorial.

## [Tutorial 7 - Introducing Domina Events][26]

Use Domina events for a more -ish approach to handling DOM events.

## [Tutorial 8 - DOM Manipulation][27]

Programmatically manipulate DOM elements in response to DOM events.

## [Tutorial 9 - Introducing AJAX][28]

Use AJAX to let the CLJS client-side code communicate with the server.

## [Tutorial 10 - A Deeper Understanding of Domina Events][29]

Apply Domina events to the login form example from the
[4th Tutorial][22].

## [Tutorial 11 - HTML on Top,  on the Bottom][30]

Explore the highest (HTML5) and deepest ( on the server) layers
of the login form example from the [previous tutorial][29].

## [Tutorial 12 - Don't Repeat Yourself][31]

Respect the [Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle][44] by sharing
validators between the client-side CLJS and the server-side .

## [Tutorial 13 - Better Safe Than Sorry (Part 1)][32]

Set the stage for unit testing by learning about the `Enlive` template
sytem and starting the shopping calculator example. Use code
refactoring to satisfy the [DRY principle][44] and to solve a cyclic
namespaces dependency problem.

## [Tutorial 14 - Better Safe Than Sorry (Part 2)][33]

Add validators to the `shoppingForm`, and do some unit testing.

## [Tutorial 15 - Better Safe Than Sorry (Part 3)][35]

Configure a development environment that simultaneously satisfy in a
single JVM the Immediate Feedback Principle by Bret Victor and the
[Test Driven Development (TDD)][45].

## [Tutorial 16 - On pleasing TDD practitioners][36]

Make the [Test Driven Development][45] Environment more customizable.

## [Tutorial 17 - REPLing with Enlive][37]

Integrate validators into a web form in such a way that the
user will be notified with the corresponding help messages when they
enter invalid values in the form.

## [Tutorial 18 - Augmented TDD session][38]

Complete the client-side form validation by exploiting the [TDD][45]
environment augmented with CLJ/CLJS REPLs.

## [Tutorial 19 - Livin' on the edge][39]

Explain how to make a library compliant with the new Reader
Conditionals extension on CLJ/CLJS compilers.

## [Tutorial 20 - House Keeping][40]

Step by step guide for publishing a library to clojar repository by
using `boot`.

## [Tutorial 21 - A reasoned porting of the Official React Tutorial to Reagent - Part I][46]

Part I of a step by step reasoned porting of the [Official React Tutorial][48] to [Reagent][49].

## [Tutorial 22 - A reasoned porting of the Official React Tutorial to Reagent - Part II][47]

Part II of a step by step reasoned porting of the [Official React Tutorial][48] to [Reagent][49].

bhauman/lein-figwheel,Clojure,"# lein-figwheel

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/bhauman/lein-figwheel.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/bhauman/lein-figwheel)

Figwheel builds your Script code and hot loads it into the browser as you are coding!

# A new Figwheel!!

There is a new Figwheel in town!

[Figwheel Main](https://figwheel.org) is a
complete re-write of Figwheel and represents the latest and greatest
version of Figwheel. It works great with Leiningen or the new 
CLI Tools.

So head over to
[Figwheel Main](https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main) to give it a
try.

# lein-figwheel

Get a quick idea of what figwheel does by watching the
6 minute [flappy bird demo of figwheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZjFVdU8VLI).

Learn even more by watching a 45 minute [talk on Figwheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-kj2qwJa_E) given at West 2015.

Read the [introductory blog post](http://rigsomelight.com/2014/05/01/interactive-programming-flappy-bird-clojurescript.html).

## Support Figwheel

If Figwheel has fundamentally redefined the way you do front-end work
please take a moment and support it:





Donated so far:     2015: $73     2016: $2752     2017(through October): $1979

#### Current version:
[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/lein-figwheel/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/lein-figwheel)

![Figwheel heads up example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bhauman-blog-images/figwheel_image.png)

## Features 

#### Live code reloading

If you write [**reloadable
code**](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel#writing-reloadable-code),
figwheel can facilitate automated live interactive programming. Every
time you save your Script source file, the changes are sent to
the browser so that you can see the effects of modifying your code in
real time.

#### Supports Node.js

You can [use figwheel to live code Script in Node.js](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/wiki/Node.js-development-with-figwheel)!

#### Static file server

The inclusion of a **static file server** allows you to get a decent
Script development environment up and running quickly. For
convenience there is a `:ring-handler` option so you can load a ring
handler into the figwheel server.

#### Live CSS reloading

Figwheel will reload your CSS live as well.

#### Live JavaScript reloading

Figwheel can live reload your JavaScript source files.

#### Heads up display

Figwheel has a non-intrusive heads up display that gives you feedback
on how well your project is compiling. By writing a shell script you
can click on files in the heads up display and they will open in your
editor!

#### Descriptive Errors with Code Context

Figwheel provides descriptive compiler errors that point to where
the error is in your code.  These errors appear in the REPL as well
as the heads up display.

#### First Class Configuration Error Reporting

It can be quite daunting, when you are configuring a tool for the
first time.  Figwheel currently offers best-of-class configuration
error reporting that will help you if you happen to misconfigure
something.

#### Built-in Script REPL

When you launch Figwheel it not only starts a live building/reloading
process but it also optionally launches a CLJS REPL into your running
application. This REPL shares compilation information with the
figwheel builder, so as you change your code the REPL is also aware of
the code changes. The REPL also has some special built-in control
functions that allow you to control the auto-building process and
execute various build tasks without having to stop and rerun lein-figwheel.

#### Robust connection

Figwheel's connection is fairly robust. I have experienced figwheel
sessions that have lasted for days through multiple OS sleeps. You can
also use figwheel like a REPL if you are OK with using `print` to output
the evaluation results to the browser console.

#### Message broadcast

Figwheel **broadcasts** changes to all connected clients. This means you
can see code and CSS changes take place in real time on your phone and
in your laptop browser simultaneously.

#### Respects dependencies

Figwheel will not load a file that has not been required. It will also
respond well to new requirements and dependency tree changes.

#### Calculates minimal reload set

Figwheel does its best to only reload what needs to be reloaded. This
minimizes the surface area of dynamically reloaded code, which in turn
should increase the stability of the client environment.

#### Doesn't load code that is generating warnings

If your Script code is generating compiler warnings Figwheel
won't load it. This, again, is very helpful in keeping the client
environment stable. This behavior is optional and can be turned off.

## Try Figwheel

Make sure you have the [latest version of leiningen installed](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation).

You can try figwheel out quickly with the flappy bird demo:

    git clone https://github.com/bhauman/flappy-bird-demo.git

then cd into `flappy-bird-demo` and type

    lein figwheel

You can now goto `localhost:3449/index.html` and open up
`src/flappy_bird_demo/core.cljs` with your favorite editor and start
coding. Make sure you open your browser's development console so you
can get feedback about code reloads.

If you would prefer to greenfield a new project you can use the
figwheel leiningen template.

    lein new figwheel hello-world

Or optionally:
```
    lein new figwheel hello-world -- --om       ;; for an om based project
    lein new figwheel hello-world -- --reagent  ;; for a reagent based project 
```

## Learning Script

If you are brand new to Script it is highly recommended that
you do the [Script Quick
Start](https://clojurescript.org/guides/quick-start)
first. If you skip this you will probably suffer.

There is a **lot to learn** when you are first learning Script,
I recommend that you bite off very small pieces at first. Smaller bites than
you would take when learning other languages like JavaScript and Ruby.

Please don't invest too much time trying to set up a sweet development
environment, there is a diverse set of tools that is constantly in
flux and it's very difficult to suss out which ones will actually help
you. If you spend a lot of time evaluating all these options it can
become very frustrating. If you wait a while, and use simple
tools you will have much more fun actually using the language itself.

## Quick Start 

If you are new to Figwheel here is a [Quick
Start](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/wiki/Quick-Start) tutorial.
Working through this Quick Start will probably save you a tremendous
amount of time.

## Getting Help

You can get help at both the [Script Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojurescript)

and on the **#clojurescript**, **#lein-figwheel** and **#beginners** [Clojurians Slack Channels](http://clojurians.net)

## Usage

Make sure you have the [latest version of leiningen installed](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation).

Then include the following `:dependencies` in your `project.clj` file.

```clojure
[org.clojure/clojure ""1.9.0""]
[org.clojure/clojurescript ""1.10.238""]
```

Then include `lein-figwheel` in the `:plugins`
section of your project.clj.

```clojure
[lein-figwheel ""0.5.18""]
```

#### Configure your builds

You also need to have your `:cljsbuild` configuration set up in your
`project.clj`.

Here is an example:

```clojure
:cljsbuild {
  :builds [ { :id ""example"" 
              :source-paths [""src/""]
              :figwheel true
              :compiler {  :main ""example.core""
                           :asset-path ""js/out""
                           :output-to ""resources/public/js/example.js""
                           :output-dir ""resources/public/js/out"" } } ]
}
```

The important part here is that you have to have at least one `build`
that has `:optimizations` set to `:none` or `nil`.

If you leave out the `:optimizations` key the Script compiler
will default to `:none`.

Setting `:figwheel true` or `:figwheel { :on-jsload ""example.core/reload-hook"" }` will
automagically insert the figwheel client code into your application.
If you supply `:on-jsload` the name of a function, that function will
be called after new code gets reloaded.

**If you want to serve the HTML file that will host your application
from figwheel's built in server**, then the output directory has to be
in a directory that can be served by the static webserver. The default
for the webserver root is ""resources/public"" so your output files need
to be in a subdirectory of ""resources/public"" unless you change the
webserver root. For now the webserver root has to be in a subdirectory
of `resources`.

If you are serving your application HTML from your own server you can
configure `:output-to` and `:output-dir` as you like.

Start the figwheel server. (This will get the first `:optimizations`
`:none` build)

    $ lein figwheel

You also have the option to specify one or more builds

    $ lein figwheel example
    $ lein figwheel example example-devcards

This will start a server at `http://localhost:3449` with your
resources being served via the compojure `resources` ring handler.

So you can load the HTML file that's hosting your Script app
by going to `http://localhost:3449/.html`

If you are using your own server please load your app from that server.

### Figwheel server side configuration

This is not necessary but you can configure the figwheel system. At
the root level of your `project.clj` you can add the following server
side configuration parameters:

```clojure
:figwheel {
   :http-server-root ""public"" ;; this will be in resources/
   :server-port 5309          ;; default is 3449
   :server-ip   ""0.0.0.0""     ;; default is ""localhost""

   ;; CSS reloading (optional)
   ;; :css-dirs has no default value 
   ;; if :css-dirs is set figwheel will detect css file changes and
   ;; send them to the browser
   :css-dirs [""resources/public/css""]

   ;; Server Ring Handler (optional)
   ;; if you want to embed a ring handler into the figwheel http-kit
   ;; server
   :ring-handler example.server/handler

   ;;  Macro reloading
   ;; disable clj file reloading
   ; :reload-clj-files false
   ;; or specify which suffixes will cause the reloading
   ; :reload-clj-files {:clj true :cljc false}

   ;; To be able to open files in your editor from the heads up display
   ;; you will need to put a script on your path.
   ;; that script will have to take a file path, a line number and a column
   ;; ie. in  ~/bin/myfile-opener
   ;; #! /bin/sh
   ;; emacsclient -n +$2:$3 $1 
   ;;
   :open-file-command ""myfile-opener""

   ;; if you want to disable the REPL
   ;; :repl false

   ;; to configure a different figwheel logfile path
   ;; :server-logfile ""tmp/logs/figwheel-logfile.log"" 

   ;; Start an nREPL server into the running figwheel process
   ;; :nrepl-port 7888

   ;; Load CIDER, refactor-nrepl and piggieback middleware
   ;;  :nrepl-middleware [""cider.nrepl/cider-middleware""
   ;;                     ""refactor-nrepl.middleware/wrap-refactor""
   ;;                     ""cemerick.piggieback/wrap-cljs-repl""]

   ;; if you need to watch files with polling instead of FS events
   ;; :hawk-options {:watcher :polling}     
   ;; ^ this can be useful in Docker environments

   ;; if your project.clj contains conflicting builds,
   ;; you can choose to only load the builds specified
   ;; on the command line
   ;; :load-all-builds false ; default is true
} 
```

## Client side usage

Make sure you have setup an html file to host your cljs. For example
you can create this `resources/public/index.html` file:

```html










```

## CSS Precompilers 

Using SASS or LESS and still want to have the benefits of live CSS reloading?

Simply run your sass or less watcher/compiler on the command line and
make sure the final output CSS files land in one of the directories
that you have listed in your `:css-dirs` configuration option (mentioned above).

See [lein-cooper](https://github.com/kouphax/lein-cooper) for a
familiar way to launch processes from lein.


## Client side configuration options 

Instead of setting `:figwheel true` in your cljsbuild configuration
you can pass a map of options as below:

```clojure
:cljsbuild {
  :builds [ { :id ""example"" 
              :source-paths [""src/""]

              ;; put client config options in :figwheel
              :figwheel { :websocket-host ""localhost"" 
                          :on-jsload ""example.core/fig-reload""}
                          
              :compiler {  :main ""example.core""
                           :asset-path ""js/out""
                           :output-to ""resources/public/js/example.js""
                           :output-dir ""resources/public/js/out""
                           :optimizations :none } } ]
}
```

The following configuration options are available:

```clojure

;; Configure :websocket-host for the figwheel js client to connect to.
;; (Don't specify the port; figwheel already knows it).
;; Defaults to ""localhost"".  Valid values are:
;; 
;;         Uses that exact string as hostname.
;;
;;   :js-client-host   Uses window.location.hostname from JS.  This is useful when connecting
;;                     from a different device/computer on your LAN, e.g. testing mobile
;;                     safari.
;;
;;   :server-ip        Uses the IP address of the figwheel server.  This is Useful in special
;;                     situations like an iOS (WK)WebView.  Be sure to check your CORS headers.
;;
;;   :server-hostname  Like :server-ip, but uses hostname string rather than IP address.
;;                     (On unix, check that `hostname` outputs the right string in shell).
;;
:websocket-host :js-client-host

;; optional callback
:on-jsload ""example.core/fig-reload""

;; if you want to do REPL based development and not have
;; have compiled files autoloaded into the client env
:autoload false

;; The heads up display is enabled by default; to disable it: 
:heads-up-display false

;; when the compiler emits warnings figwheel blocks the loading of files.
;; To disable this behavior:
:load-warninged-code true

;; You can override the websocket url that is used by the figwheel client
;; by specifying a :websocket-url
;;
;; The value of :websocket-url is usually
;; :websocket-url ""ws://localhost:3449/figwheel-ws""
;;
;; The :websocket-url is normally derived from the :websocket-host option.
;; If you supply a :websocket-url the :websocket-host option will be ignored.
;;
;; The :websocket-url allows you to use tags for common dynamic values.
;; For example in:
;; :websocket-url ""ws://[[client-hostname]]:[[server-port]]/figwheel-ws""
;; Figwheel will fill in the [[client-hostname]] and [[server-port]] tags
;;
;; Available tags are
;; [[server-hostname]]
;; [[server-ip]]
;; [[server-port]]
;; [[client-hostname]]
;; [[client-port]]
```

### More Figwheel Configuration Information

All Figwheel configuration options are fully specified in 
[sidecar/src/figwheel_sidecar/schemas/config.clj](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/blob/master/sidecar/src/figwheel_sidecar/schemas/config.clj). 

This is currently the ultimate configuration reference. (I'm planning on generating 
an official config reference from this file.)

### Preventing and forcing file reloads

Figwheel normally reloads any file that has changed. If you want to
prevent certain files from being **reloaded** by figwheel, you can add
meta-data to the namespace declaration like so:

```clojure
(ns ^:figwheel-no-load example.core)
```

Figwheel will not load or reload files that haven't been required by
your application. If you want to force a file to be loaded when it
changes add the follwoing meta-data the namespace declaration of the file:

```clojure
(ns ^:figwheel-load example.core)
```

It can be very helpful to have a file reload every time a file changes
in your Script source tree. This can facilitate reloading your
main app and running tests on change.

To force a file to reload on every change:

```clojure
(ns ^:figwheel-always example.test-runner)
```


#### Using the Script REPL

When you run `lein figwheel` a REPL will be launched into your application.

You will need to open your application in a browser in order for the
REPL to connect and show its prompt.

This REPL is a little different than other REPLs in that it has live
compile information from the build process. This effectively means
that you will not have to call `(require` or `(load-namespace` unless
it is a namespace that isn't in your loaded application's required
dependencies. In many cases you can just `(in-ns 'my.namespace)` and
everything you need to access will be there already.

The REPL get's its syntax highlighting and other features from the
[rebel-readline](https://github.com/bhauman/rebel-readline) library.

You can type `:repl/help` to learn more about how to use it.

> For Windows: Rebel-readline will not be automatically included on
> windows you will have to use `lein trampoline figwheel` in order to
> get rebel-readline. And this should be done with the knowledge that
> the classpath may be corrupted if it gets too long and thus things
> will stop working.
> See [Scripting Figwheel](#scripting-figwheel) below if you want to use
> rebel-readline in a stable manner



##### REPL Figwheel control functions.

The Figwheel REPL has the following control functions:

```
Figwheel Controls:
 (stop-autobuild)            ;; stops Figwheel autobuilder
 (start-autobuild [id ...])  ;; starts autobuilder focused on optional ids
 (switch-to-build id ...)    ;; switches autobuilder to different build
 (reset-autobuild)           ;; stops, cleans, and starts autobuilder
 (build-once [id ...])       ;; builds source one time
 (clean-builds [id ..])      ;; deletes compiled cljs target files
 (fig-status)                ;; displays current state of system
```

These functions are special functions that poke through the
Script env into the underlying  process. As such you
can't compose them.

You can think of these functions having an implicit set of build ids
that they operate on.

If you call `(reset-autobuild)` it will stop the figwheel autobuilder,
clean the builds, reload the build configuration from your
`project.clj` and then restart the autobuild process.

If you call `(stop-autobuild)` it will stop the figwheel autobuilder.

If you call `(start-autobuild)` it will start the figwheel autobuilder
with the current implicit build ids.

If you call `(start-autobuild example)` it will start the figwheel
autobuilder on the provided build id `example`. It will also make
`[example]` the implicit set of build ids.

`start-autobuild` and `switch-to-build` are the only functions that
update the build-id set.

`clean-builds` and `build-once` both allow you to do one off builds and
cleans.  They do not alter the implicit build ids.

`fig-status` displays information on the current Figwheel system state,
including whether the autobuilder is running, which build ids are in
focus, and the number of client connections.

## Editor REPLs and nREPL

You may want a REPL in your editor. This makes it much easier to ship code
from your buffer to be evaluated.

> If you use `lein repl` or something that invokes it like CIDER, you
> are using nREPL. A Script REPL will not just run over an nREPL
> connection without Piggieback.

If you are just starting out I would use the Figwheel console REPL because it's
aready set up and ready to go, complexity conquered!

If you want to integrate a REPL into your editor, here are my top
recommendations:

**Emacs**:
* use `inf-clojure` as described on the [wiki page](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/wiki/Running-figwheel-with-Emacs-Inferior--Interaction-Mode)
* alternatively use [Cider and nREPL](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/wiki/Using-the-Figwheel-REPL-within-NRepl). *Using the Script REPL over an nREPL connection is considered advanced*

**Cursive**: use the instructions on the [wiki page](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/wiki/Running-figwheel-in-a-Cursive--REPL)

**Vi**: use `tmux` mode to interact with the figwheel REPL, still trying to get a wiki page for this if you can help that would be great

If you are going to use nREPL with Figwheel please see:

[Using Figwheel within NRepl](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/wiki/Using-the-Figwheel-REPL-within-NRepl)

## Scripting Figwheel

As your development workflow grows in complexity, the declarative
approach of `lein` can be limiting when you want to launch and control
different services (ie. SASS compilation). It is really helpful to use
 itself to script whatever workflow services you want.

Figwheel has a 
[API](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/blob/master/sidecar/src/figwheel_sidecar/repl_api.clj)
that makes it easy to start, stop and control Figwheel from .

In order for the following examples to work, you will need to have
`[figwheel-sidecar ""0.5.18""]` and
`[com.bhauman/rebel-readline ""0.1.4""]` in your dependencies.

To start Figwheel from a script, you will need to require the
`figwheel-sidecar.repl-api` and provide your build configuration to
`figwheel-sidecar.repl-api/start-figwheel!` like so:

```clojure
(require '[figwheel-sidecar.repl-api :as ra])

;; this will start figwheel and will start autocompiling the builds specified in `:builds-ids`
(ra/start-figwheel!
  {:figwheel-options {} ;; <-- figwheel server config goes here 
   :build-ids [""dev""]   ;; <-- a vector of build ids to start autobuilding
   :all-builds          ;; <-- supply your build configs here
   [{:id ""dev""
     :figwheel true
     :source-paths [""src""]
     :compiler {:main ""example.core""
                :asset-path ""out""
                :output-to ""resources/public/main.js""
                :output-dir ""resources/public/out""
                :verbose true}}]})
                
;; you can also just call (ra/start-figwheel!)
;; and figwheel will do its best to get your config from the
;; project.clj or a figwheel.edn file

;; start a Script REPL
(ra/cljs-repl)
;; you can optionally supply a build id
;; (ra/cljs-repl ""dev"")
```

>  **Build config notes**
>
>  It's important to remember that figwheel can autobuild and reload
>  multiple builds at the same time. It can also switch between builds
>  and focus on autobuilding one at a time. For this reason you need

Assuming the above script is in `script/figwheel.clj` you can invoke it as follows:

```
$ lein trampoline run -m clojure.main script/figwheel.clj
```

The above command will start figwheel and it will behave just like
running `lein figwheel`.

Please note that the above command is not running the script in the
same environment as `lein repl` or `cider-jack-in`. Both of these
start an nREPL session. I am intentionally not using nREPL in order to
remove a lot of complexity from Script REPL communication.

> If you are using nREPL, launching the Script REPL
> requires that you have Piggieback installed. Please see the section
> above titled ""Editor REPLs and nREPL""

Let's make a small helper library and then initialize a  REPL with it:

```clojure
(require
 '[figwheel-sidecar.repl-api :as ra])

(defn start []
  (ra/start-figwheel!
    {:figwheel-options {} ;; <-- figwheel server config goes here 
     :build-ids [""dev""]   ;; <-- a vector of build ids to start autobuilding
     :all-builds          ;; <-- supply your build configs here
     [{:id ""dev""
       :figwheel true
       :source-paths [""src""]
       :compiler {:main ""example.core""
                  :asset-path ""out""
                  :output-to ""resources/public/main.js""
                  :output-dir ""resources/public/out""
                  :verbose true}}]}))

;; Please note that when you stop the Figwheel Server http-kit throws
;; a java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException, this is expected

(defn stop []
  (ra/stop-figwheel!))

(defn repl []
  (ra/cljs-repl))
```

The next line will call `clojure.main` and initialize it with our
script and then continue on to launch a REPL.

```
$ lein trampoline run -m clojure.main --init script/figwheel.clj -m rebel-readline.main
```

After the  REPL has launched, you will now have the ability to
call `(start)`, `(repl)` and `(stop)` as you need.

You can also call all of the functions in the [figwheel-sidecar.repl-api](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/blob/master/sidecar/src/figwheel_sidecar/repl_api.clj).

This is a powerful way to work, as you now have the interactivity and
generality of the  programming language available.

Need to start a server? Go for it.Need to watch and compile SASS files? No problem.

### Tips and Support

Figwheel was created out of the pure desire to make programming more
fun. While I have been lucky to receive a couple spontaneous donations,
it is not currently sponsored in any way.

If you like Figwheel and want to support its development:





### Not Magic, just plain old file reloading 

This plugin starts a Script auto builder, opens a websocket and
starts static file server. When you save a Script file,
Figwheel will detect that and compile it and other affected files. It
will then pass a list of those changed files off to the figwheel
server. The figwheel server will in turn push the paths of the
**relevant** compiled javascript files through a websocket so that the
browser can reload them.

The main motivation for lein-figwheel is to allow for the interactive
development of Script. Figwheel doesn't provide this out of the
box, **the developer has to take care to make their code reloadable**. 

## Writing reloadable code

Figwheel relies on having files that can be reloaded. 

Reloading works beautifully on referentially transparent code and
code that only defines behavior without bundling state with the
behavior. 

If you are using React or Om it's not hard to write reloadable code,
in fact you might be doing it already.

There are several coding patterns to look out for when writing
reloadable code. 

One problematic pattern is top level definitions that have local
state.

```clojure
(def state (atom {}))
```

The `state` definition above is holding an atom that has local state.
Every time the file that holds this definition gets reloaded the state
definition will be redefined and the state it holds will be reset back
to the original state. But with figwheel we are wanting to change our
programs while maintaining the state of the running program.

The way to fix this is to use `defonce`

```clojure
(defonce state (atom {}))
```

This will fix most situations where you have code that is relying on a
definition that has local state. Keep in mind though that if you
change the code that is wrapped in a `defonce` you won't see the
changes, because the identifier won't be redefined.

Complicated object networks wired together with callbacks (Backbone,
Ember, etc.) are also problematic. Instantiating these object callback
networks and then storing them in a global var is yet another version
of this problem.

Functions that maintain local state like counters and such are also
definitions with local state, and as such are problematic.

You also need to look out for common setup code that hooks into the browser.

Often you will see statements like this at the bottom of a file.

```clojure
(.click ($ ""a.button"") (fn [e] (print ""clicked button"")))
```

Every time this file gets loaded a new listener will get added to all
the anchor tags with a ""button"" class. This is obviously not what we
want to happen.

This code is very problematic and points to the why using the browser
APIs directly has always been really difficult. For instance if we make
it so that these hooks are only executed once, like so:

```clojure
(defonce setup-stuff 
  (do 
     (.click ($ ""a.button"") (fn [e] (print ""clicked button"")))))
```

When you are live editing code, this doesn't work very well. If you
alter your HTML template any new ""a.button"" elements aren't going to
have the listener bound to them.

You can fix this by using an event delegation strategy as so:

```clojure  
(defonce setup-stuff 
  (do 
     (.on ($ ""div#app"") ""click"" ""a.button"" (fn [e] (print ""clicked button"")))))
```

But even with the above strategy you won't be able to edit any of the
code in the setup up block and see your changes take effect.

If you are not using React and you want to build things this way and
have reloadable code we need to create `setup` and `teardown`
functions to be invoked on code reload.  

```clojure  
(defn setup []
   (.on ($ ""div#app"") ""click"" ""a.button"" (fn [e] (print ""clicked button""))))

(defn teardown []
   (.off ($ ""div#app"") ""click"" ""a.button""))

;; define a :on-jsload hook in your :cljsbuild options
(defn fig-reload-hook []
      (teardown)
      (setup))

```

Now you can edit the code in the setup and teardown functions and see
the resulting changes in your application.

In a way you can think of the previous definitions of `setup-stuff` as
functions that have local state of sorts. They are altering and storing
callbacks in the DOM directly and this is why it is so problematic.

This is one of the reasons React is so damn brilliant. You never end
up storing things directly in the DOM. State is mediated and managed
for you. You just describe what should be there and then React takes
care of making the appropriate changes. For this reason React is a
prime candidate for writing reloadable code. React components already
have a lifecycle protocol that embeds `setup` and `teardown` in each
component and invokes them when neccessary.

It is worth repeating that React components don't have local state, it
just looks like they do. You have to ask for the local state and React in
turn looks this state up in a larger state context and returns it,
very similar to a State Monad.

Reloadable code is easy to write if we are very conscious and careful
about the storage of state, state transitions and side effects. Since
a great deal of programming complexity stems from complex interactions
(side effecting events) between things that have local state, it is my
belief that reloadable code is often simply better code.

box developer take care make code reloadable writing reloadable code figwheel relies files reloaded reloading works beautifully referentially transparent code code defines behavior without bundling state behavior using react om hard write reloadable code fact might already several coding patterns look writing reloadable code one problematic pattern top level definitions local state clojure def state atom state definition holding atom local state every time file holds definition gets reloaded state definition redefined state holds reset back original state figwheel wanting change programs maintaining state running program way fix use defonce clojure defonce state atom fix situations code relying definition local state keep mind though change code wrapped defonce wont see changes identifier wont redefined complicated object networks wired together callbacks backbone ember etc also problematic instantiating object callback networks storing global var yet another version problem functions maintain local state like counters also definitions local state problematic also need look common setup code hooks browser often see statements like bottom file clojure click abutton fn e print clicked button every time file gets loaded new listener get added anchor tags button class obviously want happen code problematic points using browser apis directly always really difficult instance make hooks executed like clojure defonce setupstuff click abutton fn e print clicked button live editing code doesnt work well alter html template new abutton elements arent going listener bound fix using event delegation strategy clojure defonce setupstuff divapp click abutton fn e print clicked button even strategy wont able edit code setup block see changes take effect using react want build things way reloadable code need create setup teardown functions invoked code reload clojure defn setup divapp click abutton fn e print clicked button defn teardown divapp click abutton define onjsload hook cljsbuild options defn figreloadhook teardown setup edit code setup teardown functions see resulting changes application way think previous definitions setupstuff functions local state sorts altering storing callbacks dom directly problematic one reasons react damn brilliant never end storing things directly dom state mediated managed describe react takes care making appropriate changes reason react prime candidate writing reloadable code react components already lifecycle protocol embeds setup teardown component invokes neccessary worth repeating react components dont local state looks like ask local state react turn looks state larger state context returns similar state monad reloadable code easy write conscious careful storage state state transitions side effects since great deal programming complexity stems complex interactions side effecting events things local state belief reloadable code often simply better code license copyright 2018 bruce hauman

jondot/graphene,CSS,"# Graphene

[Graphene](http://jondot.github.com/graphene/) is a realtime dashboard & graphing toolkit based on [D3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) and [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).  

It was made to offer a very aesthetic realtime dashboard that lives on top of [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) (but could be tailored to any back
end, eventually).  

Combining D3's immense capabilities of managing live data, and Backbone's
ease of development, Graphene provides a solution capable of
displaying thousands upon thousands of datapoints in your dashboard, as well as presenting a very hackable project to build on and customize.

# Getting Started

Currently, Graphene loves Graphite's data model (through its API).  


To start,

    $ git clone git://github.com/jondot/graphene.git
    $ cd graphene


## Running the Example

Use the `/example` dashboard to build on.

You should serve that folder off some kind of a helper webserver. For
Ruby:

    $ gem install serve
    $ serve .

And open up your browser at `http://localhost:4000/example/dashboard.html`. You
should see the dashboard alive, rigged with a demo data provider.

## Setting up a Dev Env

This is a no brainer. You gotta have Ruby though; back to your root
Graphene folder,

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec guard start

This gives you an autogenerated build when you modify stuff in app/css
and app/js. Take note that `dashboard.html` points to the `build` folder
where your assets are automatically built to.




## Building a Dashboard

You are probably wondering how do you disconnect the demo data provider
and plug the Graphite data source. Don't worry - more about it
after this.  


As of now, you can place 3 types of data-enabled widgets on your
dashboard: `TimeSeries`, `GaugeLabel`, and a `GaugeGadget`  
You can have as many of these as you want, and you can also hook up
several widgets to the same data source.


To build a new dashboard, you can/should use the builder:

```javascript
var g = new Graphene;
g.demo(); // hook up demo provider, override all urls.
g.build(description);
```


Where `description` will be the hardest thing you'll have to do here. It is a hash structure, note that urls (since we use demo provider) do nothing. Here:

```javascript
description = {
  ""Total Notifications"": {
    source: ""http://localhost:4567/"",
    GaugeLabel: {
      parent: ""#hero-one"",
      title: ""Notifications Served"",
      type: ""max""
    }
  },
  ""Poll Time"": {
    source: ""http://localhost:4567/"",
    GaugeGadget: {
      parent: ""#hero-one"",
      title: ""P1""
    }
  },
  """": {
    source: """",
    """": {
      parent: """",
      title: """"
      // ... many other view opts ...
    }
  }
}
```


That's it basically. Advise the example for how your page should be
structured.


## Using Real Data

Lets see how to hook up a Graphite data source. You should first have an
idea of how your dashboard looks like in ""standard"" graphite dashboard.  

This means you can go ahead and build (or use) your dash with the
""standard"" dashboard tool that Graphite provides.  

## Cross-Domain
In any case, if you don't have your dashboard on the Graphite domain,
you might have a cross-domain issue. In this case please set up your Chrome browser with `google-chrome --disable-web-security`.

## Graphite Data API
Then, given that you saved your Graphite dashboard named `resources`,
fetch this URL:

    http:///dashboard/load/resources

You should see a JSON structure which contain these:


    /render?from=-2hours&until=now&width=400&height=250⌖=some.metric&title=my_metric

Use that query. Append `&format=json` to it and you've got a
Graphene-ready URL!


    http:///render?from=-2hours&until=now&width=400&height=250⌖=some.metric&title=my_metric&format=json



# Autodiscovery

If all you really want is to migrate your Graphite ""old"" dash, a good
starting point would be with `discover()`, which will take all of your
timeseries and convert to a dashboard running Graphene TimeSeries:

```javascript
var g = new Graphene;
g.discover('http://my.graphite.host.com', 'dev-pollers', function(i, url){ return ""#dashboard""; }, function(description){
  g.build(description);
  console.log(description);
});
```

You should specify `graphite host`, `dashboard name`, a `parent
specifier` which is responsible to spit out the next graph parent, and a
`result callback`.

You can also use the `description` result as a starting point for
building a more elaborate dashboard.

Check out an example at `/examples/dashboard-autodiscover.html`


# I Want More!

Since Graphene is really a Backbone application (View, and Model, no
Controller here), you should be aware that your data is fetched to a
Model, munged on, and 'broadcasted' to interested parties (such as widgets).  

This means you can take a look at the Model, and be able to configure it
to your own needs. One example is specifying a `refresh_interval`.   

It wouldn't make sense to poll on your Graphite backend frequently, if the
data is updated slowly; turn `refresh_interval` up a notch.

## Extra View options
You can drop any of the below options in the builder's dashboard
description.


### GaugeLabel

* `unit` - unit to display, example ""km"", or ""req/s""
* `title` - the gauge title
* `type` - how should data get aggregated?
  * `max` picks the largest value in the set of datapoints,
  * `min` picks the smallest value in the set of datapoints,
  * `current` picks the newest value in the set of datapoints,
  * null or no setting picks the first value in the set.
* `value_format` - you can specify a value formatter (see d3)



### GaugeGadget

* `title` - again, gauge title
* `type` - same as GaugeLabel
* `value_format` - value format
* `from` - start value of the gauge
* `to` - end value of the gauge


### TimeSeries

* `line_height` - visuals, default 16
* `animate_ms` - new data animation in
* `num_labels` - max labels to display at the bottom
* `sort_labels` - order labels will be sorted
* `display_verticals` - display vertical ticks (eww!)
* `width` - box width
* `height` - box height
* `padding` - the kind of padding you need
* `title` - box title
* `label_formatter` - and a formatter, as before.
* `ymax` - the max value for the Y axis. If not specified and the URL has a yMax parameter, the value will be taken from the URL. Otherwise, this option will have precedence.
* `ymin` - the min value for the Y axis. 


# Visuals

Good news, other than problems with managing TONS of data points, I avoided using common graphing libraries because it's kinda hard to fit to how they see the world in terms of styling.  

Here you'll be able to just style with . Most graph elements are SVG,
and you already have a good example of a high-contrast styling that I
use.  

Futher SVG is vector graphics. Try stretching up your dashboard, and
you'll find the quality of render isn't affected.

Applying just common  rules should give you everything that you need.

## Colors
A good thing to think about is colors in your graph. In a time series,
you'd want each graph to appear distinct from the other, but still keep
a general notion of style (relate to the previous one).  
To do that, I've generated colors based on HSL, taking the next color on
the wheel serially, and keeping a good distance for a good contrast.  
For more detail, see `/tools`


# Roadmap

These significant features will happen in the following weeks:

* Visual hints. Lower/upper threshold options for TimeSeries. Once a
  value passes above/below these, the Graph will give a visual cue
(flashing, heartbeat)
* RSS widget. Include a stream of events using an RSS feed; provide
  regex rules which cause RSS entries to be included, or be classified
as various levels of alerts. The goal is to be able to incorporate
 source control history (GitHub events), and alert feeds from other systems.

> Yeoman generator for [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) - lets you quickly set up a project including karma test runner and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) module system.

# About
Generator-React-Webpack will help you build new React projects using modern technologies.

Out of the box it comes with support for:
- Webpack
- ES2015 via Babel-Loader
- Different supported style languages (sass, scss, less, stylus)
- Style transformations via PostCSS
- Automatic code linting via esLint
- Ability to unit test components via Karma and Mocha/Chai

## Changes since version 2.0
This generator is written in ES2015. This means it is ___not compatible with node.js versions before 4.0___.

It also does __NOT__ include support for Flux-Frameworks anymore. Instead, we will use it as a base for other generators to build upon. This will make the base generator easier to use and update.

If you are interested, feel free to write your own generator and use generator-react-webpack as a base (via composition).

If you have built a generator using generator-react-webpack, tell us and we will add a link to our README.

## Generators that extend generator-react-webpack
- [Generator-React-Webpack-Alt](https://github.com/weblogixx/generator-react-webpack-alt) (Adds ability to create actions, stores and sources for [alt.js](http://alt.js.org))
- [Generator-React-Webpack-Redux](https://github.com/stylesuxx/generator-react-webpack-redux) (Adds ability to create actions and reducers for [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux))

---

## Installation
```bash
# Make sure both is installed globally
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-react-webpack
```

## Setting up projects
```bash
# Create a new directory, and `cd` into it:
mkdir my-new-project && cd my-new-project

# Run the generator
yo react-webpack
```

Please make sure to edit your newly generated `package.json` file to set description, author information and the like.

## Generating new components
```bash
# After setup of course :)
# cd my-new-project
yo react-webpack:component my/namespaced/components/name
```

The above command will create a new component, as well as its stylesheet and a basic testcase.

## Generating new stateless functional components
```
yo react-webpack:component my/namespaced/components/name --stateless
```

Stateless functional components where introduced in React v0.14. They have a much shorter syntax than regular ones and no state or lifecycle methods at all. Please read the [React 0.14 release notes](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) to get more information about those components.

___Note___: You will still be able to set properties for stateless components!

## Adding PostCSS plugins
If you have enabled [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) at generation time, install your PostCSS plugins via npm and *require* it in **postcss** function in *cfg/base.js*.

Example for autoprefixer:
```bash
cd my-new-project
npm install autoprefixer
```
Require in *cfg/base.js*
```
...
postcss: function () {
  return [
    require('autoprefixer')({
      browsers: ['last 2 versions', 'ie >= 8']
    })
  ];
}
...
```

## Usage
The following commands are available in your project:
```bash
# Start for development
npm start # or
npm run serve

# Start the dev-server with the dist version
npm run serve:dist

# Just build the dist version and copy static files
npm run dist

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Auto-run unit tests on file changes
npm run test:watch

# Lint all files in src (also automatically done AFTER tests are run)
npm run lint

# Clean up the dist directory
npm run clean

# Just copy the static assets
npm run copy
```

### Naming Components
We have opted to follow [@floydophone](https://twitter.com/floydophone) convention of uppercase for component file naming e.g. [Component.js](https://github.com/petehunt/ReactHack/tree/master/src/components). I am open to suggestions if there is a general objection to this decision.

### Modules
Each component is a module and can be required using the [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) module system. [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) uses [Loaders](http://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html) which means you can also require CSS and a host of other file types. Read the [Webpack documentation](http://webpack.github.io/docs/home.html) to find out more.

## Props
Thanks to [Edd Hannay](https://github.com/eddhannay) for his Webpack optimisations, my local merge and testing meant his additions lost his signature (my fault, sorry). So, big thanks Edd.

## Contribute
Contributions are welcomed. When submitting a bugfix, write a test that exposes the bug and fails before applying your fix. Submit the test alongside the fix.

### Running Tests
`npm test` or `node node_modules/.bin/mocha`

        ek_bar.getEtChat().addEmoticonFilter(new EmojiFilter());
```

# Else 

 if you want to change the System status bar   
 
 ```java
 
 // like this
 getWindow().getDecorView().setSystemUiVisibility(View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN);
 
 // this
 if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) {
     getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_TRANSLUCENT_STATUS);
}
        
 ```
you should add a Layout on the outside , demo ->   [SimpleTranslucentChatActivity](https://github.com/w446108264/XhsEmoticonsKeyboard/blob/master/XhsEmoticonsKeyboard/app/src/main/java/com/xhsemoticonskeyboard/activity/SimpleTranslucentChatActivity.java)

kolyvan/kxmovie,Objective-C,"FFmpegPlayer-iOS - A movie player for iOS based on FFmpeg.
==========================================================

### Build Instructions

First you need to download, configure and build [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/index.html). For this, open console and type in:
	
	cd kxmovie
	git submodule update --init	
	rake

### Usage

1. Drop files from kxmovie/output folder in your project.
2. Add frameworks: MediaPlayer, CoreAudio, AudioToolbox, Accelerate, QuartzCore, OpenGLES and libz.dylib .
3. Add libs: libkxmovie.a, libavcodec.a, libavformat.a, libavutil.a, libswscale.a, libswresample.a

For play movies:

	ViewController *vc;
	vc = [KxMovieViewController movieViewControllerWithContentPath:path parameters:nil];
	[self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:nil];

See KxMovieExample demo project as example of using.

Also, you can include kxmovie as subproject. Look at [kxtorrent](https://github.com/kolyvan/kxtorrent) as example.

Remember, you need to copy some movies via iTunes for playing them. And you can use kxmovie for streaming from remote sources via rtsp, rtmp, http, etc.

### Requirements

At least iOS 7.0 and iPhone 4 (because of iOS 7 requirements).

Scalding is a  library that makes it easy to specify Hadoop MapReduce jobs. Scalding is built on top of [Cascading](http://www.cascading.org/), a Java library that abstracts away low-level Hadoop details. Scalding is comparable to [Pig](http://pig.apache.org/), but offers tight integration with , bringing advantages of  to your MapReduce jobs.

![Scalding Logo](https://raw.github.com/twitter/scalding/develop/logo/scalding.png)

## Word Count

Hadoop is a distributed system for counting words. Here is how it's done in Scalding.

```scala
package com.twitter.scalding.examples

import com.twitter.scalding._
import com.twitter.scalding.source.TypedText

class WordCountJob(args: Args) extends Job(args) {
  TypedPipe.from(TextLine(args(""input"")))
    .flatMap { line => tokenize(line) }
    .groupBy { word => word } // use each word for a key
    .size // in each group, get the size
    .write(TypedText.tsv[(String, Long)](args(""output"")))

  // Split a piece of text into individual words.
  def tokenize(text: String): Array[String] = {
    // Lowercase each word and remove punctuation.
    text.toLowerCase.replaceAll(""[^a-zA-Z0-9\\s]"", """").split(""\\s+"")
  }
}
```

Notice that the `tokenize` function, which is standard , integrates naturally with the rest of the MapReduce job. This is a very powerful feature of Scalding. (Compare it to the use of UDFs in Pig.)

You can find more example code under [examples/](https://github.com/twitter/scalding/tree/master/scalding-commons/src/main/scala/com/twitter/scalding/examples). If you're interested in comparing Scalding to other languages, see our [Rosetta Code page](https://github.com/twitter/scalding/wiki/Rosetta-Code), which has several MapReduce tasks in Scalding and other frameworks (e.g., Pig and Hadoop Streaming).

* [Scalding docs](http://twitter.github.com/scalding) provide details beyond the API References. Prefer using this as it's always up to date.
* [**REPL in Wonderland**](tutorial/WONDERLAND.md) a hands-on tour of the scalding REPL requiring only git and java installed.
* [**Runnable tutorials**](https://github.com/twitter/scalding/tree/master/tutorial) in the source.
* The API Reference, including many example Scalding snippets:
  * [Type-safe API Reference](https://github.com/twitter/scalding/wiki/Type-safe-api-reference)
  * [Fields-based API Reference](https://github.com/twitter/scalding/wiki/Fields-based-API-Reference)
* The Matrix Library provides a way of working with key-attribute-value scalding pipes:
  * The [Introduction to Matrix Library](https://github.com/twitter/scalding/wiki/Introduction-to-Matrix-Library) contains an overview and a ""getting started"" example
  * The [Matrix API Reference](https://github.com/twitter/scalding/wiki/Matrix-API-Reference) contains the Matrix Library API reference with examples
* [**Introduction to Scalding Execution**](https://github.com/twitter/scalding/wiki/Calling-Scalding-from-inside-your-application) contains general rules and examples of calling Scalding from inside another application.

## Get Involved + Code of Conduct
Pull requests and bug reports are always welcome!

We use a lightweight form of project governence inspired by the one used by Apache projects.
Please see [Contributing and Committership](https://github.com/twitter/analytics-infra-governance#contributing-and-committership) for our code of conduct and our pull request review process.
The TL;DR is send us a pull request, iterate on the feedback + discussion, and get a +1 from a [Committer](COMMITTERS.md) in order to get your PR accepted.

The current list of active committers (who can +1 a pull request) can be found here: [Committers](COMMITTERS.md)

A list of contributors to the project can be found here: [Contributors](https://github.com/twitter/scalding/graphs/contributors)

## Building
There is a script (called sbt) in the root that loads the correct sbt version to build:

1. ```./sbt update``` (takes 2 minutes or more)
2. ```./sbt test```
3. ```./sbt assembly``` (needed to make the jar used by the scald.rb script)

The test suite takes a while to run. When you're in sbt, here's a shortcut to run just one test:

```> test-only com.twitter.scalding.FileSourceTest```

Please refer to [FAQ page](https://github.com/twitter/scalding/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions#issues-with-sbt) if you encounter problems when using sbt.

We use Github Actions to verify the build:
[![Build Status](https://github.com/twitter/scalding/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/twitter/scalding/actions)

We use [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/r/twitter/scalding) for code coverage results:
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/twitter/scalding/badge.png?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/r/twitter/scalding?branch=develop)

Scalding modules are available from maven central.

The current groupid and version for all modules is, respectively, `""com.twitter""` and  `0.17.2`.

Current published artifacts are

* `scalding-core_2.11`, `scalding-core_2.12`
* `scalding-args_2.11`, `scalding-args_2.12`
* `scalding-date_2.11`, `scalding-date_2.12`
* `scalding-commons_2.11`, `scalding-commons_2.12`

## Adding to project ##

### Sdk Version ###
`compileSdkVersion` >= 25

### Importing to project(choose one) ###

#### Example for Gradle: ####

Step 1. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```groovy
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url ""https://jitpack.io"" }
		maven { url ""https://maven.google.com"" }
	}
}
```

Step 2. Add the dependency
1. old version support lib is 25 or 26
```groovy
compile 'com.github.ittianyu:BottomNavigationViewEx:1.2.4'
compile ""com.android.support:design:26.+""
```
2. new version support lib = 28
```groovy
implementation 'com.github.ittianyu:BottomNavigationViewEx:2.0.4'
implementation ""com.android.support:design:28.0.0""
```
3. AndroidX
use new version，and add config into gradle.properties
```
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```

#### Manual: ####

Downloading [BottomNavigationViewEx.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ittianyu/BottomNavigationViewEx/master/widget/src/main/java/com/ittianyu/bottomnavigationviewex/BottomNavigationViewEx.java) and copying it to you project.


## Getting started ##

Adding a custom widget in `xml` :
```xml

```

Binding view in `Activity`:
```java
BottomNavigationViewEx bnve = (BottomNavigationViewEx) findViewById(R.id.bnve);
```

#### Disable all animations ####
```java
bnve.enableAnimation(false);
bnve.enableShiftingMode(false);
bnve.enableItemShiftingMode(false);
```

#### Custom text and icon size ####
```java
bnve.setIconSize(widthDp, heightDp);
bnve.setTextSize(sp);
```

#### Binding with ViewPager ####
```java
// set adapter
adapter = new VpAdapter(getSupportFragmentManager(), fragments);
bind.vp.setAdapter(adapter);

// binding with ViewPager
bind.bnve.setupWithViewPager(bind.vp);
```

#### Add badge view ####

1. Add badge lib
	```
	compile 'q.rorbin:badgeview:1.1.0'
	```
2. Bind bottom view
	```
    // add badge
    addBadgeAt(2, 1);

    private Badge addBadgeAt(int position, int number) {
        // add badge
        return new QBadgeView(this)
                .setBadgeNumber(number)
                .setGravityOffset(12, 2, true)
                .bindTarget(bind.bnve.getBottomNavigationItemView(position))
                .setOnDragStateChangedListener(new Badge.OnDragStateChangedListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onDragStateChanged(int dragState, Badge badge, View targetView) {
                        if (Badge.OnDragStateChangedListener.STATE_SUCCEED == dragState)
                            Toast.makeText(BadgeViewActivity.this, R.string.tips_badge_removed, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                    }
                });
    }
	```

#### Other usage in BottomNavigationViewEx ####
You can see the demo.

#### Usage in BottomNavigationView ####
Other usage is the same as official `BottomNavigationView`.
You can [click here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/BottomNavigationView.html) for detail.

## References ##

The lib is based on `BottomNavigationView` in `Support Library 25 design`.

I found it was inflexible when I tried the demo. For example, I couldn't change the currently checked item through code. So I wrote a class to extend it to provide some useful methods.

You have no need to worry about stability, because I minimised the modifications through reflection.

ivacf/archi,Java,"# Archi
This repository showcases and compares different architectural patterns that can be used to build Android apps. The exact same sample app is built three times using the following approaches:
* __Standard Android__: traditional approach with layouts, Activities/Fragments and Model.
* __MVP__: Model View Presenter.
* __MVVM__: Model View ViewModel with data binding. 

## The App

The sample app displays a list of GitHub public repositories for a given username. Tapping on one of them will open a repository details screen, where more information about the repo can be found. This screen also shows information about the owner of the repository. 

![Screenshots](images/archi-screenshots.png)

### Libraries used 
* AppCompat, CardView and RecyclerView
* Data Binding (only MVVM)
* Rx & RxAndroid
* Retrofit 2
* Picasso
* Mockito
* Robolectric

## Standard Android
The `/app` directoy contains the implementation that follows the traditional standard Android approach. This is a couple of layout files, two Activities and the model. The model is exactly the same for the three implementations and it contains: `Repository`, `User` and a retrofit service (`GithubService`).

With this approach, Activities are in charge of calling the `GithubService`, processing the data and updating the views. They act kind of like a controller in MVC but with some extra responsibilities that should be part of the view. The problem with this standard architecture is that Activities and Fragments can become quite large and very difficult to tests. Hence why I didn't write any unit test for this case. 

## MVP - Model View Presenter
In `/app-mvp` you will find the sample app implemented following this pattern. When using mvp, Activities and Fragments become part of the view layer and they delegate most of the work to presenters. Each Activity has a matching presenter that handles accessing the model via the `GithubService`. They also notify the Activities when the data is ready to display. Unit testing presenters becomes very easy by mocking the view layer (Activities).

## MVVM - Model View ViewModel
This pattern has recently started to gain popularity due to the release of the [data binding library](https://developer.android.com/tools/data-binding/guide.html). You will find the implementation in `/app-mvvm`. In this case, ViewModels retrieve data from the model when requested from the view via data binding. With this pattern, Activities and Fragments become very lightweight. Moreover, writting unit tests becomes easier because the ViewModels are decoupled from the view.

burke/zeus,Go,"# Zeus

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/zeus-application-preloader/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/zeus-application-preloader/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/zeus-application-preloader/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/burke/zeus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/burke/zeus)

Zeus preloads your Rails app so that your normal development tasks such as `console`, `server`, `generate`, and specs/tests take **less than one second**.

This screencast gives a quick overview of how to use zeus with Rails.

[![Watch the screencast!](http://s3.amazonaws.com/burkelibbey/vimeo-zeus.png)](http://vimeo.com/burkelibbey/zeus)

Zeus is also covered in [RailsCasts episode 412](http://railscasts.com/episodes/412-fast-rails-commands).

More generally, Zeus is a language-agnostic application checkpointer for non-multithreaded applications. Currently only ruby is targeted, but explicit support for other languages is possible.


## Requirements (for use with Rails)

* OS X 10.7+ *OR* Linux 2.6.13+
* Rails 3.x or 4.x
* Compatible Ruby installation
  * Ruby 2.0+
  * Rubinius

**Please note**: Zeus requires your project to be running on a file system that supports FSEvents or inotify. This means no NFS, CIFS, Samba, or VBox/VMWare shared folders.


## Installation

Install the gem.

    gem install zeus

Q: ""I should put it in my `Gemfile`, right?""

A: No. You can, but running `bundle exec zeus` instead of `zeus` adds precious seconds to commands that otherwise would be quite a bit faster. Zeus was built to be run from outside of bundler.

#### IMPORTANT

It is common to see tests running twice when starting out with Zeus. If you see your tests/specs running twice, you should try disabling `require 'rspec/autotest'` and `require 'rspec/autorun'` (for RSpec), or `require 'minitest/autorun'` (for Minitest). (see [#134](https://github.com/burke/zeus/issues/134) for more information).


## Rails Set up 

In your app's directory initialize zeus:

    zeus init

which will create two files

    custom_plan.rb
    zeus.json

Force the test environment: In `test/test_helper.rb` (or `spec/spec_helper.rb` if using RSpec), change:


    ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= 'test'

To:

    ENV['RAILS_ENV'] = 'test'

_More helpful set up hints at [this very nice guide put together by Thoughtbot](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/improving-rails-boot-time-with-zeus)_

## Usage

Start the server:

    zeus start

The server will print a list of available commands.

Run some commands in another shell:

    zeus console
    zeus server
    zeus test test/unit/widget_test.rb
    zeus test spec/widget_spec.rb
    zeus generate model omg
    zeus rake -T
    zeus runner omg.rb

## Limitations

You need to restart zeus if you make changes to various initialization files. Examples of these files include:

 * FactoryGirl factories
 * RSpec support files

## Related gems

* [Spork](https://github.com/sporkrb/spork) - a [DRb server](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/drb/rdoc/DRb.html) that forks before each run to ensure a clean testing state
* [Commands](https://github.com/rails/commands) - a persistent console that runs Rails commands without reloading the env
* [Spring](https://github.com/rails/spring) - like Zeus but in pure Ruby, totally automatic, and included in Rails 4.1+.

If you're switching from Spork, be sure to [read the wiki page on Spork](https://github.com/burke/zeus/wiki/Spork).


## Customizing Zeus Commands

To add/modify commands, see [`docs/ruby/modifying.md`](docs/ruby/modifying.md).


## Contributing

To get started hacking on Zeus itself, see [`docs/overview.md`](docs/overview.md).

See also the handy contribution guide at [`contributing.md`](contributing.md).


## Rails 2.3 Support

The default plan bundled with zeus only supports Rails 3.x and 4.x. There is a project to provide Rails 2.3 support [here](https://github.com/tyler-smith/zeus-rails23), however it has not been updated in some time.

## Legacy Ruby Versions

Due to official Ruby support lapsing in Feb 2015, Ruby 1.9.3 and below are no longer officially supported. Zeus may work with them but we are not actively supporting them at this time. The last release tested with these versions is [0.15.4](https://github.com/burke/zeus/tree/v0.15.4).

daimajia/AndroidViewHover,Java,"# Android View Hover [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/daimajia/AndroidViewHover.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/daimajia/AndroidViewHover)

In my opinion, jumping to a new activity to show your menu is a kind of wasting time and life.

So,

I think, we need a hover view, to show menu, to show messages.

## Demo

Watch HD in [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsDQbMTtPvM).

Download [Apk](https://github.com/daimajia/AndroidViewHover/releases/download/v1.0.0/AndroidViewHover-v1.0.0.apk)

## Usage

### Step0

Set up RenderScript

- Eclipse, please visit [official tutorial](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/renderscript/compute.html#access-rs-apis).
- Android Studio, add 
	```groovy
	        
	        renderscriptTargetApi 19
        	renderscriptSupportMode true
	```
	in `build.gradle` `defaultConfig`, here is a [sample](https://github.com/daimajia/AndroidViewHover/blob/master/library/build.gradle#L12-L13)
	

### Step1

#### Gradle
```groovy
dependencies {
	compile ""com.android.support:support-v4:20.+""
	compile 'com.nineoldandroids:library:2.4.0'
	compile 'com.daimajia.easing:library:1.0.0@aar'
	compile 'com.daimajia.androidanimations:library:1.1.2@aar'
	compile 'com.daimajia.androidviewhover:library:1.0.4@aar'
}
```

#### Maven

```xml
	
com.nineoldandroids
library
2.4.0


com.daimajia.androidanimation
library
1.1.2
apklib


com.daimajia.easing
library
1.0.0
apklib


com.daimajia.androidviewhover
library
1.0.4
apklib

```


#### Eclipse
- SupportLibrary v4
- [NineOldAndroids-2.4.0](https://github.com/downloads/JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids/nineoldandroids-2.4.0.jar)
- [AndroidViewAnimations-1.1.2](https://github.com/daimajia/AndroidViewAnimations/releases/download/v1.1.2/AndroidViewAnimations-1.1.2.jar)
- [AndroidEasingFunctions-1.0.0](https://github.com/daimajia/AndroidViewAnimations/releases/download/v1.0.6/AndroidEasingFunctions-1.0.0.jar)
- [AndroidViewHover-1.0.3](https://github.com/daimajia/AndroidViewHover/releases/download/v1.0.3/AndroidViewHover-v1.0.3.jar)

### Step2

![](http://ww4.sinaimg.cn/mw690/610dc034jw1ej5giogymhj20dw085q36.jpg)

1. Create an original view, and make sure it was wrapped by `BlurLayout`

	for example:
	```xml
		


	```
	Note: `BlurLayout` is entended from `RelativeLayout`. You can use the `RelativeLayout` rules to layout your view.


2. 	Create a hover view, there is no rules to obey. Just please remember that this view will be stretched as large as the original view you have created.

3.	Bind a hover view to `BlurLayout` 


	```java
		BlurLayout sampleLayout = (BlurLayout)findViewById(R.id.sample);
		View hover = LayoutInflater.from(mContext).inflate(R.layout.hover, null);
		sampleLayout.setHoverView(hover);
	```

	and don't forget that you can add various animations just in one line code. For example:
	```java
		//View (R.id.heart) appear animation.
		sampleLayout.addChildAppearAnimator(hover, R.id.heart, Techniques.FlipInX);
		//View (R.id.heart) disappear animation.
		sampleLayout.addChildDisappearAnimator(hover, R.id.heart, Techniques.FlipOutX);
	```

You can view the samples in my [preset examples](https://github.com/daimajia/AndroidViewHover/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/com/daimajia/androidviewhover/demo/MainActivity.java).

# Animations

This project provides a lot of animations you can choose. Animations are from my another open-source project [AndroidViewAnimations](https://github.com/daimajia/AndroidViewAnimations#effects). And you can aslo using [easing funcitons](https://github.com/daimajia/AnimationEasingFunctions) to make your animations more real. Please enjoy it.

chrislusf/glow,Go,"# glow
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chrislusf/glow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chrislusf/glow)
[![Doc](https://godoc.org/github.com/chrislusf/glow?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/chrislusf/glow)

# Purpose

Glow is providing a library to easily compute in parallel threads or distributed to clusters of machines. This is written in pure .

I am also working on another pure- system, https://github.com/chrislusf/gleam , which is more flexible and more performant.

# Installation
```
$ go get github.com/chrislusf/glow
$ go get github.com/chrislusf/glow/flow
```

# One minute tutorial

## Simple Start

Here is a simple full example:

```go
package main

import (
	""flag""
	""strings""

	""github.com/chrislusf/glow/flow""
)

func main() {
	flag.Parse()

	flow.New().TextFile(
		""/etc/passwd"", 3,
	).Filter(func(line string) bool {
		return !strings.HasPrefix(line, ""#"")
	}).Map(func(line string, ch chan string) {
		for _, token := range strings.Split(line, "":"") {
			ch <- token
		}
	}).Map(func(key string) int {
		return 1
	}).Reduce(func(x int, y int) int {
		return x + y
	}).Map(func(x int) {
		println(""count:"", x)
	}).Run()
}

```

Try it.
```
  $ ./word_count
```

It will run the input text file, '/etc/passwd', in 3 go routines, filter/map/map, and then reduced to one number in one goroutine (not exactly one goroutine, but let's skip the details for now.) and print it out.

This is useful already, saving lots of idiomatic but repetitive code on channels, sync wait, etc, to fully utilize more CPU cores.

However, there is one more thing! It can run across a Glow cluster, which can be run multiple servers/racks/data centers!

## Scale it out
To setup the Glow cluster, we do not need experts on Zookeeper/HDFS/Mesos/YARN etc. Just build or download one binary file.

### Setup the cluster
```shell
  # Fetch and install via go, or just download it from somewhere.
  $ go get github.com/chrislusf/glow
  # Run a script from the root directory of the repo to start a test cluster.
  $ etc/start_local_glow_cluster.sh
```
Glow Master and Glow Agent run very efficiently. They take about 6.5MB and 5.5MB memory respectively in my environments. I would recommend set up agents on any server you can find. You can tap into the computing power whenever you need to.

### Start the driver program
To leap from one computer to clusters of computers, add this line to the import list:

```go
	_ ""github.com/chrislusf/glow/driver""
```

And put this line as the first statement in the main() function:

```go
	flag.Parse()
```

This will ""steroidize"" the code to run in cluster mode!

```
$ ./word_count -glow -glow.leader=""localhost:8930""
```
The word_count program will become a driver program, dividing the execution into a directed acyclic graph(DAG), and send tasks to agents.

### Visualize the flow

To understand how each executor works, you can visualize the flow by generating a dot file of the flow, and render it to png file via ""dot"" command provided from graphviz.
```
$ ./word_count -glow -glow.flow.plot > x.dot
$ dot -Tpng -otestSelfJoin.png x.dot
```

boxen/boxen,Ruby,"# Boxen [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/boxen/boxen.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/boxen/boxen)

Manage Mac development boxes with love (and Puppet).

## Rules for Services

0. Run on a nonstandard port, usually default port + 1000 or 10000.

0. Install with a custom Boxen homebrew formula.

0. Suffix the Homebrew package's version, starting with `-boxen1`.

0. Run as a launchd service in the `dev` namespace, e.g.,
   `dev.dnsmasq`.

0. Store config, data, and log files in
   `$BOXEN_HOME/{config,data,log}`. This will normally require
   customization of a service's Homebrew formula.

Sometimes it's not possible to follow these rules, but try hard.

## Projects from the CLI

We use a totally awful hack to do from-the-cli project installs of projects.
We create a file in ""$BOXEN_HOME/repodir"" called .projects, with a single line.
That line is made up of projects separated by commas.
We then read that into a Puppet fact in Puppet-land, and that checks for
classes that match those project names, and includes them in the catalog.

We can't pass a `FACTER_` env var because sudo has `env_reset`
and we can't just modify the sudoers file due to a chicken-egg problem.

## Hooks

0. All hooks must be in the namespace `Boxen::Hook::MyThing`.

0. All hooks must subclass from `Boxen::Hook`

0. All hooks must provide a private instance method `required_environment_variables` that returns an array with at least one entry.

0. All hooks must provide a private instance method `#call`.

## Contributing

Use the OS X system  (2.0 or newer). Run `script/tests` often. Open PR's.
Use the CI.

## Halp!

Use Issues or #boxen on irc.freenode.net.

ramsaylanier/WordExpress,JavaScript,"# WordPress Express

**UPDATE** This project has been moved into several separate repositories.

I encourage you to check out [wordexpress.io](http://wordexpress.io) for documentation. This is a still a thing!

First, you'll need [WordExpress Server](https://github.com/ramsaylanier/WordExpress-Server). WordExpress Server is a GraphQL server built using [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/). This connects to your WordPress database and provides you with an HTTP endpoint that you can send GraphQL queries. WordExpress Server uses [WordExpress Schema](https://github.com/ramsaylanier/WordExpressSchema), which is a GraphQL schema that provides GraphQL types and queries for querying 

Second, you'll need to take a look at a starter kit. I have created a kit for [Vue](https://github.com/ramsaylanier/wordexpress-starter-vue) and for [React](https://github.com/ramsaylanier/wordexpress-starter-react). Fair warning, I've spent much more time developing the Vue starter kit than the React one. The starter kits provide you with everything you'll need to get up and running on the front end.

mikeash/MAObjCRuntime,Objective-C,"MAObjCRuntime
-------------

MAObjCRuntime is an ObjC wrapper around the  runtime APIs. If that's confusing, it provides a nice object-oriented interface around (some of) the C functions in /usr/include/objc.

MAObjCRuntime is released under a BSD license. For the official license, see the LICENSE file.

Quick Start
-----------

The action begins in `MARTNSObject.h`. Various methods are added to `NSObject` to allow querying and manipulation. Most of these are class methods, because they operate on classes. There are a couple of instance methods as well. All of these methods start with `rt_` to avoid name conflicts. The `RTMethod` and `RTIvar` classes are used to represent a single method and a single instance variable, respectively. Their use should be fairly obvious.

Querying
--------

You can query any class's methods, instance variables, or other attributes using the methods provided. For example:

    // get all subclasses of a class
    NSArray *subclasses = [MyClass rt_subclasses];
    
    // check out the methods on NSString
    NSArray *methods = [NSString rt_methods];
    for(RTMethod *method in methods)
        NSLog(@""%@"", method);
    
    // does it have any ivars?
    NSLog(@""%@"", [NSString rt_ivars]);
    
    // how big is a constant string instance?
    NSLog(@""%ld"", (long)[[@""foo"" rt_class] rt_instanceSize]);

Modifying
---------

You can add new methods using `+rt_addMethod:`. You can modify the implementation of an existing method using the `-setImplementation:` method on `RTMethod`. Example:

    // swizzle out -[NSObject description] (don't do this)
    static NSString *NewDescription(id self, SEL _cmd)
    {
        return @""HELLO WORLD!"";
    }
    
    Method *description = [NSObject rt_methodForSelector: @selector(description)];
    [description setImplementation: (IMP)NewDescription];

You can create new classes using `+rt_createSubclassNamed:` or `+rt_createUnregisteredSubclassNamed:`. Note that if you want to add instance variables to a class then you have to use the Unregistered version, and add them before registering the class.

Objects
-------

Two instance methods are provided as well. `-rt_class` exists because Apple likes to fiddle with the return value of `-class`, and `-rt_class` always gives you the right value. `-rt_setClass:` does pretty much what it says: sets the class of the object. It won't reallocate the object or anything, so the new class had better have a memory layout that's compatible with the old one, or else hilarity will ensue.

Sending Messages
----------------

After getting a list of methods from a class, it's common to want to actually use those on instances of the class. `RTMethod` provides an easy method for doing this, as well as several convenience wrappers around it.

The basic method for sending messages is `-[RTMethod returnValue:sendToTarget:]`. You use it like this:

    RTMethod *method = ...;
    SomeType ret;
    [method returnValue: &ret sendToTarget: obj, RTARG(@""hello""), RTARG(42), RTARG(xyz)];

It may seem odd to have the return value at the beginning of the argument list, but this comes closest to the order of the normal `ret = [obj method]` syntax.

All arguments must be wrapped in the `RTARG` macro. This macro takes care of packaging up each argument so that it can survive passage through the variable argument list and also includes some extra metadata about the argument types so that the code can do some basic sanity checking. No automatic type conversions are performed. If you pass a `double` to a method that expects an `int`, this method will `abort`. That checking is only based on size, however, so if you pass a `float` where an `int` is expected, you'll just get a bad value.

Note that while it's not 100% guaranteed, this code does a generally good job of detecting if you forgot to use the `RTARG` macro and warning you loudly and calling `abort` instead of simply crashing in a mysterious manner. Also note that there is no sanity checking on the return value, so it's your responsibility to ensure that you use the right type and have enough space to hold it.

For methods which return an object, the `-[RTMethod sendToTarget:]` method is provided which directly returns `id` instead of making you use return-by-reference. This simplifies the calling of such methods:

    RTMethod *method = ...;
    id ret = [method sendToTarget: obj, RTARG(@""hello""), RTARG(42), RTARG(xyz)];

There is also an `NSObject` category which provides methods that allows you to switch the order around to be more natural. For example:

    RTMethod *method = ...;
    id ret = [obj rt_sendMethod: method, RTARG(@""hello""), RTARG(42), RTARG(xyz)];

And the same idea for `rt_returnValue:sendMethod:`.

Finally, there are a pair of convenience methods that take a selector, and combine the method lookup with the actual message sending:

    id ret = [obj rt_sendSelector: @selector(...), RTARG(@""hello""), RTARG(42), RTARG(xyz)];
    SomeType ret2;
    [obj rt_returnValue: &ret2 sendSelector: @selector(...), RTARG(12345)];

cwRichardKim/RKDropdownAlert,Objective-C,"RKDropdownAlert
======================

an extremely simple (and customizeable) alert alternative based on Facebook's app Slingshot, and inspiration from SVProgressHUD (yes, it's just as easy to use as SV).

## Updates, Questions, and Requests

__Article comparing UIAlertView, SVProgressHUD and RKropdownAlert__

https://medium.com/@cwRichardKim/devux-uialertview-alternatives-3a78ab64cbf8

## Pod
WAIT! Don't use pods if you want to customize or use the quick and easy [RKDropdownAlert show]

	pod 'RKDropdownAlert'

## Demo:
``` objc
[RKDropdownAlert title:@""Hello World"" message:@""Tons better than UIAlertView!""];
```
![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/tE5p9L0.gif?1)

## In Action:
![first](http://i.imgur.com/d6voW3W.gif)  

![second](http://i.imgur.com/OlYystx.gif)

## Easy Default Call
``` objc
[RKDropdownAlert show];
```
Set the default text, color, size, font, etc so that when you call ""show"" it pulls up an easy default call

![easy](http://i.imgur.com/M0cH5DF.gif?1)

## Setup


First, download the file, or create a branch of the repo. Copy the following into your parent controller:
``` objc
# import ""RKDropdownAlert.h""
```

You will probably want to customize the default call ([RKDropdownAlert show]), as well as other features such as color, the method called when the user taps the view, etc.  Look for
``` objc
//%%% CUSTOMIZE
```
tags in the RKDropdownAlert.m for methods that you should customize.


## Calling the Alert

Use the following variations of title, message, backgroundColor, textColor, and time
``` objc
+(void)show;
+(void)title:(NSString*)title;
+(void)title:(NSString*)title time:(NSInteger)seconds;
+(void)title:(NSString*)title backgroundColor:(UIColor*)backgroundColor textColor:(UIColor*)textColor;
+(void)title:(NSString*)title backgroundColor:(UIColor*)backgroundColor textColor:(UIColor*)textColor time:(NSInteger)seconds;

+(void)title:(NSString*)title message:(NSString*)message;
+(void)title:(NSString*)title message:(NSString*)message time:(NSInteger)seconds;
+(void)title:(NSString*)title message:(NSString*)message backgroundColor:(UIColor*)backgroundColor textColor:(UIColor*)textColor;
+(void)title:(NSString*)title message:(NSString*)message backgroundColor:(UIColor*)backgroundColor textColor:(UIColor*)textColor time:(NSInteger)seconds;
```

For example:
``` objc
[RKDropdownAlert show];

[RKDropdownAlert title:@""this is a title"" message:@""this is a one line message""];

[RKDropdownAlert title:@""Hello World"" message:@""tons better than UIAlertView"" backgroundColor:[UIColor grayColor] textColor:[UIColor whiteColor] time:10];
```

## Touch Up Inside Method
Write your own method for when the user touches the view (default is hide the view)

``` objc
@interface WhateverClassYouLike : NSObject 
@end

@implementation WhateverClassYouLike

-(BOOL)dropdownAlertWasTapped:(RKDropdownAlert*)alert {
	// Handle the tap, then return whether or not the alert should hide.
	return true;
}

@end

### Areas for Future Improvement / Involvement
* Improve architecture to maintain single line deployment while also allowing for attribute customization without changing physical code
* Ability to change layout of text without changing physical code
* Singleton pattern
* More rigorous case testing for responsive design (making sure different text lengths still look good)

MatthewYork/MYBlurIntroductionView,Objective-C,"MYBlurIntroductionView
======================

#####NOTICE: As of February 4th, Apple has begun to ban new app submissions using the common blurring method (UIToolbar hack) found in MYBlurIntroductionView. We will work toward a new solution, but unfortunately this library has removed the blurring functionality until a solution is found. Cheers.

![Intro](https://raw.github.com/MatthewYork/MYBlurIntroductionView/master/Resources/Images/MYBlurIntroductionView.gif)

## A Controller Built With You In Mind

It's time for one introduction/tutorial view to end them all! MYBlurIntroductionView is a powerful platform to build introductions for your iPhone apps. Built on the [MYIntroductionView](https://github.com/MatthewYork/iPhone-IntroductionTutorial) core, MYBlurIntroductionView takes the first time user experience to the next level by providing a host of new features for building **highly customized introductions**.

**Features Include**
* Brand new stock panels built for iOS 7
* Optional overlay on background images
* Add **custom panels** straight from .xib files
* Subclass MYIntroductionPanel (the stock panel) for **custom panels** with access to new methods like
  * panelDidAppear 
  * panelDidDisappear
  * enable/disable
* Delegates methods for panel change and introduction finishing events
* iOS 6 and 7 compatible for iPhone (iPad coming soon)
* Localized Skip Button
* Right-to-Left Language Support

## What to Include

### Manual Installation

MYBlurIntroductionView is dependent on the following files and frameworks
* MYBlurIntroductionView.{h,m}
* MYIntroductionPanel.{h,m}
* Uses the QuartzCore framework
* Requires ARC

### CocoaPods

MYBlurIntroductionView is also available for installation through cocoapods by using the following command.

pod 'MYBlurIntroductionView'

For help setting up and maintaining dependencies using CocoaPods check out this link: http://cocoapods.org/


## The Process

Creating an introduction view can basically be boiled down to these steps

1. Create panels
2. Create and MYIntroductionView
3. Add MYIntroductionPanels to MYIntroductionView
4. Show View

## Creating Panels

### Stock Panels

One goal for MYBlurIntroductionView is to make the creation of stock (or ""non-custom"") panels just as easy as with MYIntroductionView. That's why the basic interface hasn't changed one bit. All content is optional and rearranges nicely for you. bl

The main panel class is MYIntroductionPanel.{h,m}. It has many different custom init methods for rapid creation of stock panels. Here are a few samples, the first with a header, and the second without.

```objc
//Create stock panel with header
UIView *headerView = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@""TestHeader"" owner:nil options:nil][0];

MYIntroductionPanel *panel1 = [[MYIntroductionPanel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height) title:@""Welcome to MYBlurIntroductionView"" description:@""MYBlurIntroductionView is a powerful platform for building app introductions and tutorials. Built on the MYIntroductionView core, this revamped version has been reengineered for beauty and greater developer control."" image:[UIImage imageNamed:@""HeaderImage.png""] header:headerView];
    
//Create stock panel with image
MYIntroductionPanel *panel2 = [[MYIntroductionPanel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height) title:@""Automated Stock Panels"" description:@""Need a quick-and-dirty solution for your app introduction? MYBlurIntroductionView comes with customizable stock panels that make writing an introduction a walk in the park. Stock panels come with optional overlay on background images. A full panel is just one method away!"" image:[UIImage imageNamed:@""ForkImage.png""]];
```

And here are the end results

![Panel1](https://raw.github.com/MatthewYork/MYBlurIntroductionView/master/Resources/Images/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20shot%20Oct%2017,%202013%203.09.52%20PM.png)
![Panel2](https://raw.github.com/MatthewYork/MYBlurIntroductionView/master/Resources/Images/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20shot%20Oct%2017,%202013%203.09.56%20PM.png)

### Custom Panels from .xib Files

One of the great things about MYBlurIntroductionView is that you can create the panels for your introduction directly from xib files. These are great for static layouts that do not need any interaction (think text and images). 

Creating a custom panel is as easy as using the initWithFrame:nibNamed: for MYIntroductionPanel.

```objc
//Create Panel From Nib
MYIntroductionPanel *panel3 = [[MYIntroductionPanel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height) nibNamed:@""TestPanel3""];
```

This will attach the xib file to a MYIntroductionPanel so it may be used in the introduction view. If you would like to use the stock title/description/header/image and their animations, simply set the desired additional attributes after the instantiation of a panel, and run the buildPanelWithFrame: method. An example can be seen below.

```objc
//Instantiate panel
MYIntroductionPanel *panel3 = [[MYIntroductionPanel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height) nibNamed:@""TestPanel3""];

//Add custom attributes
panel3.PanelTitle = @""Test Title"";
panel3.PanelDescription = @""This is a test panel description to test out the new animations on a custom nib"";

//Rebuild panel with new attributes
[panel3 buildPanelWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height)];
```

**Tip** Make sure your autoresize properties are set to scale correctly (everything selected worked best for me). If you don't there may be some problems when you design for 4"" screens, but deploy on 3.5"".

### Custom Panels via Subclassing

If you really want to unleash the full power of MYBlurIntroductionView, you will want to subclass an MYIntroductionPanel. If you do, you gain access to many new methods for creating event driven panels in your introduction. 

**Event Handling**

Perhaps you would like to trigger certain actions to occur on a panel when the introduction reaches it. Now that is fully possible by overriding the panelDidAppear and panelDidDisappear methods. Using these methods you can create dynamic panels that reset when the panel disappears.

**Stopping**

Say, for intstance, you want to make SURE a user knows how to do something in your app. With your subclass, you may now disable the introduction view until they have completed whatever task you like. Once they have done that task, they may go to the next panel. An example of this can be found using the command [self.parentIntroductionView setEnabled:NO]; in the MYCustomPanel class in the sample application. Here, a button press enables movement to the next panel.

![DisabledPanel](https://raw.github.com/MatthewYork/MYBlurIntroductionView/master/Resources/Images/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20shot%20Oct%2017,%202013%204.42.36%20PM.png)
![EnabledPanel](https://raw.github.com/MatthewYork/MYBlurIntroductionView/master/Resources/Images/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20shot%20Oct%2017,%202013%204.42.38%20PM.png)

## Creating a MYIntroductionView and Adding Panels
 
Assuming you have made a few panels, creating an instance of MYIntroductionView and adding panels can be done in just a few lines of code.

```objc
//Create the introduction view and set its delegate
MYBlurIntroductionView *introductionView = [[MYBlurIntroductionView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height)];
    introductionView.delegate = self;
    introductionView.BackgroundImageView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""Toronto, ON.jpg""];
    //introductionView.LanguageDirection = MYLanguageDirectionRightToLeft;

//Feel free to customize your introduction view here
    
//Add panels to an array
NSArray *panels = @[panel1, panel2, panel3, panel4];
    
//Build the introduction with desired panels
[introductionView buildIntroductionWithPanels:panels];
```

The buildIntroductionWithPanels method is where all the magic happens. After calling this method, the introduction view is ready to display. To finally show it, simply add it as a subview.

```objc
//Add the introduction to your view
[self.view addSubview:introductionView];
```

To see all this in action, head over to the sample project! It creates an introduction view that uses all types of panels so you can understand all that MYBlurIntroductionView has to offer.

## Delegation

MYBlurIntroductionView comes with two delegate methods for interacting with the introduction view.
* **introduction:didChangeToPanel:withIndex:**
  * This method will hit every time you change panels. Use this to perhaps change background images or blur color.
* **introduction:didFinishWithType:**
  * This method triggers when the introduction view has finished. The type of finish is also provided.

scottyab/secure-preferences,Java,"Secure-preferences - Deprecated 
==================

* Please use EncryptedSharedPreferences from [androidx.security](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/security) in preferenced to secure-preference. (There are no active maintainers Secure-preferences) 

This is Android Shared preference wrapper that encrypts the values of Shared Preferences using *AES 128*, *CBC*, and *PKCS5* padding with integrity checking in the form of a SHA 256 hash. Each key is stored as a one way SHA 256 hash. Both keys and values are base64 encoded before storing into prefs xml file. **By default the generated key is stored in the backing preferences file and so can be read and extracted by root user.** Recommend use the user password generated option as added in v0.1.0.

The sample app is available on [playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.securepreferences.sample)


 

## Release v0.1.0+
The **v0.1.0** release was a major refactor of the guts of secure prefs, which is *Not backwards compatible* yet with older 0.0.1 - 0.0.4 versions. So if you have an existing app using this don't upgrade. I'll be looking to add migration into a later release.

[Full list of changes](changes.md)

# Usage

## Dependency

Maven central is the preferred way:

Note: v0.1.0 was dependent on snapshot of aes-crypto, this is only as I was waiting for the aes-crypto repo owner to upload to maven. I've sorted this for v0.1.1+ which is no longer dependent on Snapshot repo.

```java
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.scottyab:secure-preferences-lib:0.1.7'
}
```

### Download
Or download the release .aar or clone this repo and add the library as a Android library project/module.

### ProGuard config

As of v0.1.4 **no** specific `-keep` config is needed.

### DexGuard

There is specific DexGuard config supplied with DexGuard 7+ located `/samples/advanced/SecurePreferences`


# Examples
This will use the default shared pref file

```java
SharedPreferences prefs = new SecurePreferences(context);     
```

## Custom pref file
You can define a separate file for encrypted preferences. 

```java
SharedPreferences prefs = new SecurePreferences(context, null, ""my_custom_prefs.xml"");
```


## User password - (recommended)
Using a password that the user types in that isn't stored elsewhere in the app passed to the SecurePreferences constructor means the key is generated at runtime and *not* stored in the backing pref file.

```java
SharedPreferences prefs = new SecurePreferences(context, ""userpassword"", ""my_user_prefs.xml"");
```

## Changing Password

```java
SecurePreferences securePrefs = new SecurePreferences(context, ""userpassword"", ""my_user_prefs.xml"");
securePrefs.handlePasswordChange(""newPassword"", context);
```


# What does the data look like?

SharedPreferences keys and values are stored as simple map in an XML file.  You could also use a rooted device and an app like [cheatdroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.felixheller.sharedprefseditor&hl=en_GB)

## XML using Standard Android SharedPreferences


```xml




```

## XML with SecurePreferences


```xml


        pD2UhS2K2MNjWm8KzpFrag==:MWm7NgaEhvaxAvA9wASUl0HUHCVBWkn3c2T1WoSAE/g=rroijgeWEGRDFSS/hg
    
k73tlfVNYsPshll19ztma7U"">
        pD2UhS2K2MNjWm8KzpFrag==:MWm7NgaEhvaxAvA9wASUl0HUHCVBWkn3c2T1WoSAE/g=:jWm8KzUl0HUHCVBWkn3c2T1WoSAE/g=
    

```


### Disclaimer
By default it's not bullet proof security (in fact it's more like obfuscation of the preferences) but it's a quick win for incrementally making your android app more secure. For instance it'll stop users on rooted devices easily modifying your app's shared prefs.
*Recommend using the user password based prefs as introduced in v0.1.0.*

Refer to Bootstrap Form Controls documentation to create inline checkboxes. Simply add `data-toggle=""toggle""` to a convert checkboxes into toggles.

```html

 First


 Second


 Third

```

## API

### Initialize by JavaScript
Initialize toggles with id `toggle-one` with a single line of JavaScript.

```html


```

### Options
Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to `data-`, as in `data-on=""Enabled""`.

```html



```

Name|Type|Default|Description|
---|---|---|---
on|string/html|""On""|Text of the on toggle
off|string/html|""Off""|Text of the off toggle
size|string|""normal""|Size of the toggle. Possible values are `large`, `normal`, `small`, `mini`.
onstyle|string|""primary""|Style of the on toggle. Possible values are `default`, `primary`, `success`, `info`, `warning`, `danger`
offstyle|string|""default""|Style of the off toggle. Possible values are `default`, `primary`, `success`, `info`, `warning`, `danger`
style|string| |Appends the value to the class attribute of the toggle. This can be used to apply custom styles. Refer to Custom Styles for reference.
width|integer|*null*|Sets the width of the toggle. if set to *null*, width will be calculated.
height|integer|*null*|Sets the height of the toggle. if set to *null*, height will be calculated.

### Methods
Methods can be used to control toggles directly.

```html

```

Method|Example|Description
---|---|---
initialize|$('#toggle-demo').bootstrapToggle()|Initializes the toggle plugin with options
destroy|$('#toggle-demo').bootstrapToggle('destroy')|Destroys the toggle
on|$('#toggle-demo').bootstrapToggle('on')|Sets the toggle to 'On' state
off|$('#toggle-demo').bootstrapToggle('off')|Sets the toggle to 'Off' state
toggle|$('#toggle-demo').bootstrapToggle('toggle')|Toggles the state of the toggle
enable|$('#toggle-demo').bootstrapToggle('enable')|Enables the toggle
disable|$('#toggle-demo').bootstrapToggle('disable')|Disables the toggle

## Events

### Event Propagation
Note All events are propagated to and from input element to the toggle.

You should listen to events from the `` directly rather than look for custom events.

```html



```

### API vs Input
This also means that using the API or Input to trigger events will work both ways.

```html

On by API
Off by API
On by Input
Off by Input

```

### Integration

#### [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com)

A binding for knockout is available here: [aAXEe/knockout-bootstrap-toggle](https://github.com/aAXEe/knockout-bootstrap-toggle)

honcheng/RTLabel,Objective-C,"RTLabel 
=======

Rich text formatting based on HTML-like markups for iOS. 



RTLabel works like UILabel, but supports html-like markups for rich text display. 
It is based on Core Text, so it supports some of the stuff that Core Text supports

Features
--------

* bold and italic style
* color and size
* stroke
* indenting
* kerning
* line spacing
* clickable links

Usage
-----

1) Drag RTLabel.h and RTLabel.m into your project. Import CoreText framework

    #import ""RTLabel.h""
	
2) Create RTLabel
	
    NSString *sample_text = @""bold,italic and underlined text, and text with custom font and color"";
	
	RTLabel *label = [[RTLabel alloc] initWithFrame:...];
	[self addSubview:label];
	[label setText:sample_text];
	
3) Supports the following tags
	
    Bold
Italic
Bold & Italic
underline, underline with color
link
double underline , double underline with color
custom font
custom font with strokes
custom font with kerning
alignment
indentation

Minimum Requirements
--------------------
* ARC - this project uses ARC. If you are not using ARC in your project, add '-fobjc-arc' as a compiler flag for StyledPageControl.h and StyledPageControl.m
* Xcode 4.4 and newer (auto-synthesis required)

# sebastian/diff

Diff implementation for , factored out of Unit into a stand-alone component.

## Installation

You can add this library as a local, per-project dependency to your project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```
composer require sebastian/diff
```

If you only need this library during development, for instance to run your project's test suite, then you should add it as a development-time dependency:

```
composer require --dev sebastian/diff
```

### Usage

#### Generating diff

The `Differ` class can be used to generate a textual representation of the difference between two strings:

```php
diff('foo', 'bar');
```

The code above yields the output below:
```diff
--- Original
+++ New
@@ @@
-foo
+bar
```

There are three output builders available in this package:

#### UnifiedDiffOutputBuilder

This is default builder, which generates the output close to udiff and is used by Unit.

```php
diff('foo', 'bar');
```

#### StrictUnifiedDiffOutputBuilder

Generates (strict) Unified diff's (unidiffs) with hunks,
similar to `diff -u` and compatible with `patch` and `git apply`.

```php
 true, // ranges of length one are rendered with the trailing `,1`
    'commonLineThreshold' => 6,    // number of same lines before ending a new hunk and creating a new one (if needed)
    'contextLines'        => 3,    // like `diff:  -u, -U NUM, --unified[=NUM]`, for patch/git apply compatibility best to keep at least @ 3
    'fromFile'            => '',
    'fromFileDate'        => null,
    'toFile'              => '',
    'toFileDate'          => null,
]);

$differ = new Differ($builder);
print $differ->diff('foo', 'bar');
```

#### DiffOnlyOutputBuilder

Output only the lines that differ.

```php
diff('foo', 'bar');
```

#### DiffOutputBuilderInterface

You can pass any output builder to the `Differ` class as longs as it implements the `DiffOutputBuilderInterface`.

#### Parsing diff

The `Parser` class can be used to parse a unified diff into an object graph:

```php
use SebastianBergmann\Diff\Parser;
use SebastianBergmann\Git;

$git = new Git('/usr/local/src/money');

$diff = $git->getDiff(
  '948a1a07768d8edd10dcefa8315c1cbeffb31833',
  'c07a373d2399f3e686234c4f7f088d635eb9641b'
);

$parser = new Parser;

print_r($parser->parse($diff));
```

The code above yields the output below:

    (
        [0] => SebastianBergmann\Diff\Diff Object
            (
                [from:SebastianBergmann\Diff\Diff:private] => a/tests/MoneyTest.php

                    )
            )
    )

Note: If the chunk size is 0 lines, i.e., `getStartRange()` or `getEndRange()` return 0, the number of line returned by `getStart()` or `getEnd()` is one lower than one would expect. It is the line number after which the chunk should be inserted or deleted; in all other cases, it gives the first line number of the replaced range of lines.

verlok/vanilla-lazyload,JavaScript,"LazyLoad is a lightweight (2.4 kB) and flexible script that **speeds up your web application** by deferring the loading of your below-the-fold images, animated SVGs, videos and iframes to **when they will enter the viewport**. It's written in plain ""vanilla"" , it leverages the [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) API, it supports [responsive images](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-images-in-practice), it optimizes your website for slower connections, and can enable native lazy loading. See [all features](#-all-features-compared) for more.

## 👨‍💻 Getting started - HTML

In order to make your content be loaded by LazyLoad, you must use some `data-` attributes instead of the actual attributes. Examples below.

### Lazy image:

```html

```

### Lazy image with low quality placeholder:

```html

```

### Lazy responsive image with `srcset` and `sizes`:

```html

```

To have a low quality placeholder, add the `src` attribute pointing to a very small version of the image. E.g. `src=""lazy_10.jpg""`.

### Lazy responsive image with hi-dpi support using the `picture` tag:

```html





```

To have a low quality placeholder, add the `src` attribute pointing to a very small version of the image to the `img` tag. E.g. `src=""lazy_10.jpg""`.

### Lazy responsive image with automatic _WebP_ format selection, using the `picture` tag:

```html




```

To have a low quality placeholder, add the `src` attribute pointing to a very small version of the image to the `img` tag. E.g. `src=""lazy_10.jpg""`.

### Lazy background image

⚠ **IMPORTANT NOTE**: To display content images on your pages, always use the `img` tag. This would benefit the SEO and the accessibility of your website. To understand if your images are content or background, ask yourself: ""would my website user like to see those images when printing out the page?"". If the answer is ""yes"", then your images are content images and you should avoid using background images to display them.

#### Single background image:

```html

```

#### Single background, with HiDPI screen support:

```html

```

#### Multiple backgrounds:

```html

  ...

```

#### Multiple backgrounds, HiDPI screen support:

```html

  ...

```

#### Backgrounds with `image-set`:

```html
...
```

#### Multiple backgrounds with `image-set`:

```html

  ...

```

### Lazy animated SVG

```html

```

### Lazy video

```html





```

Please note that the video poster can be lazily loaded too.

### Lazy iframe

```html

```

## 👩‍💻 Getting started - Script

The latest, recommended version of LazyLoad is **17.8.3**.

Quickly understand how to upgrade from a previous version reading the [practical upgrade guide](UPGRADE.md).

### The simple, easiest way

The easiest way to use LazyLoad is to include the script from a CDN:

```html

```

Then, in your javascript code:

```js
var lazyLoadInstance = new LazyLoad({
  // Your custom settings go here
});
```

To be sure that DOM for your lazy content is ready when you instantiate LazyLoad, **place the script tag right before the closing `` tag**. If more DOM arrives later, e.g. via an AJAX call, you'll need to call `lazyLoadInstance.update();` to make LazyLoad check the DOM again.

```js
lazyLoadInstance.update();
```

### Using an `async` script

If you prefer, it's possible to include LazyLoad's script using `async` script and initialize it as soon as it's loaded.

To do so, **you must define the options before including the script**. You can pass:

- `{}` an object to get a single instance of LazyLoad
- `[{}, {}]` an array of objects to get multiple instances of LazyLoad, each one with different options.

```html

```

Then include the script.

```html

```

**Possibly place the script tag right before the closing `` tag**. If you can't do that, LazyLoad could be executed before the browser has loaded all the DOM, and you'll need to call its `update()` method to make it check the DOM again.

### Using an `async` script + getting the instance reference

Same as above, but you must put the `addEventListener` code shown below before including the `async` script.

```html

```

Then include the script.

```html

```

Now you'll be able to call its methods, like:

```js
lazyLoadInstance.update();
```

Note about Internet Explorer: because this technique uses a `CustomEvent` to trigger the `LazyLoad::Initialized` event, you might want to add [this polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/CustomEvent#Polyfill) to make it work on Internet Explorer.

[DEMO](https://www.andreaverlicchi.eu/vanilla-lazyload/demos/async.html) - [SOURCE](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload/blob/master/demos/async.html) ← for a single LazyLoad instance

[DEMO](https://www.andreaverlicchi.eu/vanilla-lazyload/demos/async_multiple.html) - [SOURCE](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload/blob/master/demos/async_multiple.html) ← for multiple LazyLoad instances

### Local install

If you prefer to install LazyLoad locally in your project, you can!

#### Using npm

```
npm install vanilla-lazyload
```

#### Using bower

```
bower install vanilla-lazyload
```

#### Manual download

Download one the latest [releases](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload/releases/). The files you need are inside the `dist` folder. If you don't know which one to pick, use `lazyload.min.js`, or read [about bundles](#bundles).

### Local usage

Should you install LazyLoad locally, you can import it as ES module like the following:

```js
import LazyLoad from ""vanilla-lazyload"";
```

It's also possible (but unadvised) to use the `require` commonJS syntax.

More information about bundling LazyLoad with WebPack are available on [this specific repo](https://github.com/verlok/lazyload-es2015-webpack-test).

### Usage with React

Take a look at this example of [usage of React with LazyLoad](https://codesandbox.io/s/20306yk96p) on Sandbox.

This implementation takes the same props that you would normally pass to the `img` tag, but it renders a lazy image. Feel free to fork and improve it!

### Bundles

Inside the `dist` folder you will find different bundles.

## Fathom Lite vs Fathom Analytics
Fathom Analytics is much more detailed, feature-rich, and even more focused on [privacy-law compliance](https://usefathom.com/compliance), than Fathom Lite. 

If you’d like to become a customer of Fathom Analytics, and not have to worry about servers, maintenance, security, you can give our software a try with a [7-day free trial](https://usefathom.com/ref/GITHUB) **(this link will give you $10 credit).**

## Introduction

A Keras implementation of YOLOv3 (Tensorflow backend) inspired by [allanzelener/YAD2K](https://github.com/allanzelener/YAD2K).


---

## Quick Start

1. Download YOLOv3 weights from [YOLO website](http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
2. Convert the Darknet YOLO model to a Keras model.
3. Run YOLO detection.

```
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
python convert.py yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights model_data/yolo.h5
python yolo_video.py [OPTIONS...] --image, for image detection mode, OR
python yolo_video.py [video_path] [output_path (optional)]
```

For Tiny YOLOv3, just do in a similar way, just specify model path and anchor path with `--model model_file` and `--anchors anchor_file`.

### Usage
Use --help to see usage of yolo_video.py:
```
usage: yolo_video.py [-h] [--model MODEL] [--anchors ANCHORS]
                     [--classes CLASSES] [--gpu_num GPU_NUM] [--image]
                     [--input] [--output]

positional arguments:
  --input        Video input path
  --output       Video output path

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --model MODEL      path to model weight file, default model_data/yolo.h5
  --anchors ANCHORS  path to anchor definitions, default
                     model_data/yolo_anchors.txt
  --classes CLASSES  path to class definitions, default
                     model_data/coco_classes.txt
  --gpu_num GPU_NUM  Number of GPU to use, default 1
  --image            Image detection mode, will ignore all positional arguments
```
---

4. MultiGPU usage: use `--gpu_num N` to use N GPUs. It is passed to the [Keras multi_gpu_model()](https://keras.io/utils/#multi_gpu_model).

## Training

1. Generate your own annotation file and class names file.  
    One row for one image;  
    Row format: `image_file_path box1 box2 ... boxN`;  
    Box format: `x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max,class_id` (no space).  
    For VOC dataset, try `python voc_annotation.py`  
    Here is an example:
    ```
    path/to/img1.jpg 50,100,150,200,0 30,50,200,120,3
    path/to/img2.jpg 120,300,250,600,2
    ...
    ```

2. Make sure you have run `python convert.py -w yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights model_data/yolo_weights.h5`  
    The file model_data/yolo_weights.h5 is used to load pretrained weights.

3. Modify train.py and start training.  
    `python train.py`  
    Use your trained weights or checkpoint weights with command line option `--model model_file` when using yolo_video.py
    Remember to modify class path or anchor path, with `--classes class_file` and `--anchors anchor_file`.

If you want to use original pretrained weights for YOLOv3:  
    1. `wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/darknet53.conv.74`  
    2. rename it as darknet53.weights  
    3. `python convert.py -w darknet53.cfg darknet53.weights model_data/darknet53_weights.h5`  
    4. use model_data/darknet53_weights.h5 in train.py

---

## Some issues to know

1. The test environment is
    -  3.5.2
    - Keras 2.1.5
    - tensorflow 1.6.0

2. Default anchors are used. If you use your own anchors, probably some changes are needed.

3. The inference result is not totally the same as Darknet but the difference is small.

4. The speed is slower than Darknet. Replacing PIL with opencv may help a little.

5. Always load pretrained weights and freeze layers in the first stage of training. Or try Darknet training. It's OK if there is a mismatch warning.

6. The training strategy is for reference only. Adjust it according to your dataset and your goal. And add further strategy if needed.

7. For speeding up the training process with frozen layers train_bottleneck.py can be used. It will compute the bottleneck features of the frozen model first and then only trains the last layers. This makes training on CPU possible in a reasonable time. See [this](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html) for more information on bottleneck features.

abel533/Mapper,Java,"# MyBatis 通用 Mapper4

[![Maven central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/tk.mybatis/mapper/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/tk.mybatis/mapper)

通用Mapper都可以极大的方便开发人员。可以随意的按照自己的需要选择通用方法，还可以很方便的开发自己的通用方法。

极其方便的使用MyBatis单表的增删改查。

支持单表操作，不支持通用的多表联合查询。

**通用 Mapper 支持 Mybatis-3.2.4 及以上版本。**

## [下一代 通用 Mapper5？](https://mapper.mybatis.io/docs/1.getting-started.html#%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D)

通用 Mapper 每次大的版本，基本上都是底层上的大变化，在使用通用 Mapper 的过程中，有很多人遇到过配置的问题，因为底层实现的方式，所以无法避免配置，而且随着功能的增加，配置也增加了不少。

为了从根本上简化通用方法的实现，从2018年就开始思考如何让实现和MyBatis的兼容性更好，让实现变的更简单，为了从 MyBatis 根本解决问题，给官方提过好几个 PR，在 2019年3月份给 MyBatis 提交的
[pr#1391](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3/pull/1391) 合并后（对应 3.5.1 版本，最低要求版本），终于能以更简单的方式来实现通用 Mapper 了。

由于此次变动太大，因此不打算对 **通用Mapper4** 进行任何改动，从头实现了一个新的项目，名字仍然没有新意的使用了 `mybatis-mapper`，推荐在新项目中使用：

- [GitHub - https://github.com/mybatis-mapper/mapper](https://github.com/mybatis-mapper/mapper)
- [Gitee - https://gitee.com/mybatis-mapper/mapper](https://gitee.com/mybatis-mapper/mapper)
- [文档: https://mapper.mybatis.io](https://mapper.mybatis.io/)
- [开发过程 - https://mapper.mybatis.io/releases/1.0.0.html](https://mapper.mybatis.io/releases/1.0.0.html)
- [快速上手 - https://mapper.mybatis.io/docs/1.getting-started.html#%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D](https://mapper.mybatis.io/docs/1.getting-started.html#%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D)

另外，通用 Mapper 中的大量 PR 都是增加的新方法和代码生成器相关的注解，这些和核心无关，因此 mybaits-mapper 会提供独立的项目接收所有新增的通用方法， 和代码生成器相关的 lombok
注解完全不需要了，使用新版本中提供的代码生成器可以更方便的进行定制。

## [**快速入门 - MyBatis 为什么需要通用 Mapper ?**](https://blog.csdn.net/isea533/article/details/83045335)

简介: 在早期项目文档中有过类似主题的内容，但是最近我自己看文档的时候发现一个问题，文档虽然很详细，但是并不适合初次接触的人。为了方便第一次听说，第一次尝试的开发人员了解通用 Mapper，补充此文档。

强烈建议初学者阅读本文，先从整体上了解 通用 Mapper，然后再通过下面的文档更深入的了解。

## [**通用 Mapper 进阶实例：为什么好久都没更新了？**](https://blog.csdn.net/isea533/article/details/104776347)

通过本文，希望读者能有收获，能根据自己的需要设计通用方法，不要只是为了偷懒将自己局限在已有的通用方法中。大而全的通用方法不一定适合自己，根据自己需要选择和设计的通用方法才更满足自己的需要。

**Records is a very simple, but powerful, library for making raw SQL queries
to most relational databases.**

.. image:: https://farm1.staticflickr.com/569/33085227621_7e8da49b90_k_d.jpg

Just write SQL. No bells, no whistles. This common task can be
surprisingly difficult with the standard tools available.
This library strives to make this workflow as simple as possible,
while providing an elegant interface to work with your query results.

*Database support includes RedShift, Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, and MS-SQL (drivers not included).*

----------

☤ The Basics
------------
We know how to write SQL, so let's send some to our database:

.. code:: python

    import records

    db = records.Database('postgres://...')
    rows = db.query('select * from active_users')    # or db.query_file('sqls/active-users.sql')


Grab one row at a time:

.. code:: python

    >>> rows[0]
    

Or iterate over them:

.. code:: python

    for r in rows:
        print(r.name, r.user_email)

Values can be accessed many ways: ``row.user_email``, ``row['user_email']``, or ``row[3]``.

Fields with non-alphanumeric characters (like spaces) are also fully supported.

Or store a copy of your record collection for later reference:

.. code:: python

    >>> rows.all()
    [, , , ...]

If you're only expecting one result:

.. code:: python

    >>> rows.first()
    

Other options include ``rows.as_dict()`` and ``rows.as_dict(ordered=True)``.

☤ Features
----------

- Iterated rows are cached for future reference.
- ``$DATABASE_URL`` environment variable support.
- Convenience ``Database.get_table_names`` method.
- Command-line `records` tool for exporting queries.
- Safe parameterization: ``Database.query('life=:everything', everything=42)``.
- Queries can be passed as strings or filenames, parameters supported.
- Transactions: ``t = Database.transaction(); t.commit()``.
- Bulk actions: ``Database.bulk_query()`` & ``Database.bulk_query_file()``.

Records is proudly powered by `SQLAlchemy `_
and `Tablib `_.

☤ Data Export Functionality
---------------------------

Records also features full Tablib integration, and allows you to export
your results to CSV, XLS, JSON, HTML Tables, YAML, or Pandas DataFrames with a single line of code.
Excellent for sharing data with friends, or generating reports.

.. code:: pycon

    >>> print(rows.dataset)
    username|active|name      |user_email       |timezone
    --------|------|----------|-----------------|--------------------------
    model-t |True  |Henry Ford|model-t@gmail.com|2016-02-06 22:28:23.894202
    ...

**Comma Separated Values (CSV)**

.. code:: pycon

    >>> print(rows.export('csv'))
    username,active,name,user_email,timezone
    model-t,True,Henry Ford,model-t@gmail.com,2016-02-06 22:28:23.894202
    ...

**YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML)**

.. code:: python

    >>> print(rows.export('yaml'))
    - {active: true, name: Henry Ford, timezone: '2016-02-06 22:28:23.894202', user_email: model-t@gmail.com, username: model-t}
    ...

**JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)**

.. code:: python

    >>> print(rows.export('json'))
    [{""username"": ""model-t"", ""active"": true, ""name"": ""Henry Ford"", ""user_email"": ""model-t@gmail.com"", ""timezone"": ""2016-02-06 22:28:23.894202""}, ...]

**Microsoft Excel (xls, xlsx)**

.. code:: python

    with open('report.xls', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(rows.export('xls'))
        
        
**Pandas DataFrame**

.. code:: python

    >>> rows.export('df')
        username  active       name        user_email                   timezone
    0    model-t    True Henry Ford model-t@gmail.com 2016-02-06 22:28:23.894202

You get the point. All other features of Tablib are also available,
so you can sort results, add/remove columns/rows, remove duplicates,
transpose the table, add separators, slice data by column, and more.

See the `Tablib Documentation `_
for more details.

☤ Installation
--------------

Of course, the recommended installation method is `pipenv `_::

    $ pipenv install records[pandas]
    ✨🍰✨

☤ Command-Line Tool
-------------------

As an added bonus, a ``records`` command-line tool is automatically
included. Here's a screenshot of the usage information:

☤ Thank You
-----------

Thanks for checking this library out! I hope you find it useful.

Of course, there's always room for improvement. Feel free to `open an issue `_ so we can make Records better, stronger, faster.

morrisjs/morris.js,CoffeeScript,"# Morris.js - pretty time-series line graphs

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/morrisjs/morris.js.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/morrisjs/morris.js)

Morris.js is the library that powers the graphs on http://howmanyleft.co.uk/.
It's a very simple API for drawing line, bar, area and donut charts.

Cheers!

\- Olly (olly@oesmith.co.uk)

## Contributors wanted

I'm unfortunately not able to actively support Morris.js any more. I keep an eye
on the issues, but I rarely have the time to fix bugs or review pull requests.

If you're interested in actively contributing to Morris.js, please contact me on
the email address above.

## Requirements

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (>= 1.7 recommended, but it'll probably work with
  older versions)
- [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/) (>= 2.0)

## Usage

See [the website](http://morrisjs.github.com/morris.js/).

## Development

Very daring.

Fork, hack, possibly even add some tests, then send a pull request :)

Remember that Morris.js is a coffeescript project. Please make your changes in
the `.coffee` files, not in the compiled javascript files in the root directory
of the project.

### Developer quick-start

You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org).  I recommend using
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for installing node in
development environments.

With node installed, install [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) using
`npm install -g grunt-cli`, and then the rest of the test/build dependencies
with `npm install` in the morris.js project folder.

Additionally, [bower](http://bower.io/) is required for for retrieving additional test dependencies.  
Install it with `npm install -g bower` and then `bower install` in the morris project folder.

Once you're all set up, you can compile, minify and run the tests using `grunt`.

Note: I'm experimenting with using perceptual diffs to catch rendering
regressions. Due to font rendering differences between platforms, the pdiff
tests currently *only* pass on OS X.

After doing this, you need to restart the Elasticsearch server. Otherwise you may get errors like `Invalid index name [sql], must not start with '']; "",""status"":400}`.

## Basic Usage

On elasticsearch 1.x / 2.x, visit the elasticsearch-sql web front-end:

````
http://localhost:9200/_plugin/sql/
````

On elasticsearch 5.x/6.x, use [elasticsearch sql site chrome extension](https://github.com/shi-yuan/elasticsearch-sql-site-chrome) (make sure to enable cors on elasticsearch.yml). Alternatively, [download and extract site](https://github.com/NLPchina/elasticsearch-sql/releases/download/5.4.1.0/es-sql-site-standalone.zip), then start the web front-end like this:

```shell
cd site-server
npm install express --save
node node-server.js 
```

* Simple query
````
curl -X GET ""localhost:9200/_nlpcn/sql"" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'select * from indexName limit 10'
````

* Explain SQL to elasticsearch query DSL
````
curl -X GET ""localhost:9200/_nlpcn/sql/explain"" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'select * from indexName limit 10'
```` 



## SQL Usage

* Query

        SELECT * FROM bank WHERE age >30 AND gender = 'm'

* Aggregation

        select COUNT(*),SUM(age),MIN(age) as m, MAX(age),AVG(age)
        FROM bank GROUP BY gender ORDER BY SUM(age), m DESC

* Delete

        DELETE FROM bank WHERE age >30 AND gender = 'm'


## Beyond SQL

* Search

        SELECT address FROM bank WHERE address = matchQuery('880 Holmes Lane') ORDER BY _score DESC LIMIT 3
        

* Aggregations

	+ range age group 20-25,25-30,30-35,35-40

			SELECT COUNT(age) FROM bank GROUP BY range(age, 20,25,30,35,40)

	+ range date group by day

			SELECT online FROM online GROUP BY date_histogram(field='insert_time','interval'='1d')

	+ range date group by your config

			SELECT online FROM online GROUP BY date_range(field='insert_time','format'='yyyy-MM-dd' ,'2014-08-18','2014-08-17','now-8d','now-7d','now-6d','now')

* ES Geographic
		
		SELECT * FROM locations WHERE GEO_BOUNDING_BOX(fieldname,100.0,1.0,101,0.0)

* Select type

        SELECT * FROM indexName/type


## SQL Features

*  SQL Select
*  SQL Delete
*  SQL Where
    * can use ""case when"" in where clause
*  SQL Order By
    * can use ""case when"" in order by clause
*  SQL Group By
*  SQL AND & OR
*  SQL Like
*  SQL COUNT distinct
*  SQL In
*  SQL Between
*  SQL Aliases
*  SQL Not Null
*  SQL(ES) Date
*  SQL avg()
*  SQL count()
*  SQL last()
*  SQL max()
*  SQL min()
*  SQL sum()
*  SQL Nulls
*  SQL isnull()
*  SQL now()
*  SQL floor
*  SQL split
*  SQL trim
*  SQL log
*  SQL log10
*  SQL substring
*  SQL round
    * eg: round(10.135, 2) --> 10.14
*  SQL sqrt
*  SQL concat_ws
*  SQL union and minus
*  SQL case when
    * can use ""in""、""not in"" judge in case when clause
    * can execute simple calculation in case when clause, eg : case when 1 = 1 then field_1 + field_2 else 0 end
*  SQL if
    * select if(sex='1','男','女') from t_user;
*  SQL limit
    * can set aggregation bucket size and shard size by setting limit, shardSize = 20 * bucketSize
    * eg: select city,count(*) as user_count from t_user group by city limit 100;
    * on the above example, the bucket size is 100, shard size is 20*100 = 2000

[![Minified Size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/min/rellax.svg?label=minified)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=rellax)

Rellax is a buttery smooth, super lightweight, vanilla javascript parallax library. **Update:** Rellax now works on mobile (v1.0.0).

* [Demo Website](https://dixonandmoe.com/rellax/)


## Getting Started
### Using npm

`npm install rellax --save`

### Using yarn

`yarn add rellax`

### CDN

``

### Download Locally

if you're old school like us download and insert `rellax.min.js` in your html


```html

  I’m that default chill speed of ""-2""


  I’m super fast!!


  I’m extra slow and smooth



```
```html

```
## Features

### Speed
Use the `data-rellax-speed` attribute to set the speed of a `.rellax` element to something other than the default value (which is `-2`). A negative value will make it move slower than regular scrolling, and a positive value will make it move faster. We recommend keeping the speed between `-10` and `10`.

#### Responsive Speed
Use responsive speed attributes for breakpoint levels that require a different speed. Defaults to the `data-rellax-speed` setting in unspecified breakpoints.
```html

  I parallax at all different speeds depending on your screen width.

```

Pass an array of breakpoints. Each breakpoint value represents the resolution for mobile, tablet, desktop respectively. Checkout the responsiveness of the [`demo`](https://dixonandmoe.com/rellax/)
```html

```


### Centering
After some fantastic work from [@p-realinho](https://github.com/p-realinho), we just released the ability to center parallax elements in your viewport! We'll be building a nice demo website, but for now check out the tests folder for several examples of how it works.

There's two ways to implement centering, either on specific elements or as a global option.
1. #### Element-wise Centering
- Add the ```data-rellax-percentage=""0.5""``` to a specific html element
```html

  I’m that default chill speed of ""-2"" and ""centered""


  I’m super fast!! And super centered!!


  I’m extra slow and smooth, and hella centered.

```
2. #### Global Centering
- To activate the center feature in your whole html, add the code your `
```

### Z-index
If you want to sort your elements properly in the Z space, you can use the data-rellax-zindex property
```html

  I’m that default chill speed of ""-2"" and default z-index of 0


  I’m super fast!! And on top of the previous element, I'm z-index 5!!

```

### Horizontal Parallax
Horizontal parallax is disabled by default. You can enable it by passing `horizontal: true` in the settings block.
This feature is intended for panoramic style websites, where users scroll horizontally instead of vertically.
Note that this can work together at the same time with the default vertical parallax. If you do not want this, pass `vertical: false` in the settings block.
```html

```

### Custom Wrapper
By default, the position of parallax elements is determined via the scroll position of the body. Passing in the `wrapper` property will tell Rellax to watch that element instead.
```html

```

### Refresh
```html

```

### Destroy
```html

```

### Callback
```html

```

### Target node
Instead of using a className you can use a node, handy when using React and you want to use `refs` instead of `className`.
```jsx
 { this.rellaxRef = ref }}>
  I’m that default chill speed of ""-2""


var rellax = new Rellax(this.rellaxRef)
```

## Development
In the spirit of lightweight javascript, the build processes (thus far) is lightweight also.

1. Open demo.html
2. Make code changes and refresh browser
3. Once feature is finished or bug fixed, use [jshint](http://jshint.com/) to lint code
4. Fix lint issues then use [Google Closure Compiler](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) to minify
5. 🍻

## Install

To install Lineman, first install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and then run:

``` bash
$ npm install -g lineman
```

To create a new project:

```
$ lineman new banana-stand
```

Which will print out some basic instructions.

vuejs/vueify,JavaScript,"# THIS REPOSITORY IS DEPRECATED

> Note: We are concentrating our efforts on supporting webpack and rollup.

## vueify [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/vuejs/vueify.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/vuejs/vueify) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/vueify.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/vueify)

> [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) transform for [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) components, with scoped CSS and component hot-reloading.

**NOTE: master branch now hosts version ^9.0, which only works with Vue ^2.0. Vueify 8.x which works with Vue 1.x is in the [8.x branch](https://github.com/vuejs/vueify/tree/8.x).**

This transform allows you to write your components in this format:

``` html
// app.vue



```

You can also mix preprocessor languages in the component file:

``` vue
// app.vue



```

And you can import using the `src` attribute:

``` html

```

Under the hood, the transform will:

- extract the styles, compile them and insert them with the `insert-css` module.
- extract the template, compile it and add it to your exported options.

You can `require()` other stuff in the `

```

If you are using `vueify` in Node:

``` js
var fs = require(""fs"")
var browserify = require('browserify')
var vueify = require('vueify')

browserify('./main.js')
  .transform(vueify)
  .bundle()
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream(""bundle.js""))
```

## Building for Production

Make sure to have the `NODE_ENV` environment variable set to `""production""` when building for production! This strips away unnecessary code (e.g. hot-reload) for smaller bundle size.

If you are using Gulp, note that `gulp --production` **does not** affect vueify; you still need to explicitly set `NODE_ENV=production`.

## ES2015 with Babel

Vueify is pre-configured to work with Babel. Simply install Babel-related dependencies:

``` bash
npm install\
  babel-core\
  babel-preset-es2015\
  --save-dev
```

Then create a `.babelrc`:

``` json
{
  ""presets"": [""es2015""]
}
```

And voila! You can now write ES2015 in your `*.vue` files. Note if you want to use ES2015 on normal `*.js` files, you will also need [babelify](https://github.com/babel/babelify).

You can also configure babel with the `babel` field in `vue.config.js`, which will take the highest priority.

## Enabling Other Pre-Processors

For other pre-processors, you also need to install the corresponding node modules to enable the compilation. e.g. to get stylus compiled in your Vue components, do `npm install stylus --save-dev`.

These are the preprocessors supported by vueify out of the box:

- stylus
- less
- scss (via `node-sass`, use `sass` in [config section](#configuring-options))
- jade
- pug
- coffee-script (use `coffee` in [config section](#configuring-options))

## PostCSS

Vueify uses PostCSS for scoped CSS rewrite. You can also provide your own PostCSS plugins! See [config section](#configuring-options) below for an example.

## Configuring Options

Create a `vue.config.js` file at where your build command is run (usually the root level of your project):

``` js
module.exports = {
  // configure a built-in compiler
  sass: {
    includePaths: [...]
  },
  // provide your own postcss plugins
  postcss: [...],
  // register custom compilers
  customCompilers: {
    // for tags with lang=""ts""
    ts: function (content, cb, compiler, filePath) {
      // content:  content extracted from lang=""ts"" blocks
      // cb:       the callback to call when you're done compiling
      // compiler: the vueify compiler instance
      // filePath: the path for the file being compiled
      //
      // compile some TypeScript... and when you're done:
      cb(null, result)
    }
  }
}
```

Example using custom PostCSS plugin:

``` js
var cssnext = require('cssnext')

module.exports = {
  postcss: [cssnext()]
}
```

Alternatively, if you are using `vueify` in Node and don't want to create a `vue.config.js` file:

``` js
var fs = require(""fs"")
var browserify = require('browserify')
var vueify = require('vueify')

// apply custom config
vueify.compiler.applyConfig({
  // ...same as in vue.config.js
})

browserify('./main.js')
  .transform(vueify)
  .bundle()
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream(""bundle.js""))
```

Or simply pass configuration object to `vueify` (in Node) (for instance to set sass search paths as in the following example):

``` js
var fs = require(""fs"")
var browserify = require('browserify')
var vueify = require('vueify')

browserify('./main.js')
  .transform(vueify, {
    sass: {
      includePaths: [...]
    },
    // ...same as in vue.config.js
  })
  .bundle()
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream(""bundle.js""))
```

## Scoped CSS

When a `

```

Into the following:

``` html


```

### Scoped CSS Notes

1. You can include both scoped and non-scoped styles in the same component.

2. The following will be affected by both the parent's scoped CSS and the child's scoped CSS:
  - A child component's root node
  - Content inserted to a child component via ``

## Hot Reload

To enable hot component reloading, you need to install the [browserify-hmr](https://github.com/AgentME/browserify-hmr) plugin:

``` bash
npm install browserify-hmr --save-dev
watchify -p browserify-hmr index.js -o bundle.js
```

You can scaffold a hot-reload enabled project easily using `vue-cli` and the [this template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/browserify-simple).

Rich-Harris/butternut,JavaScript,"# Butternut

The fast, future-friendly minifier. [Try before you buy at butternut.now.sh](https://butternut.now.sh)

*Warning: this is alpha software. Test thoroughly before using in production! Consider using the [check option](#the-check-option). Please report any bugs you find!*


## Why?

Butternut is significantly faster than other  minifiers, and works with the latest version of  (ES2015, aka ES6, and beyond). It's typically around 3x faster than [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) with default minify options, and 10-15x faster than [Babili](https://github.com/babel/babili).

The compression is better than Babili and [closure-compiler-js](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler-js) (in standard compilation mode — you can get better results with Closure in advanced mode, but only by writing your code in a very particular way). It's *almost* as good as Uglify in its current version.

You can test out the different tools with `npm run bench`.

*Note: UglifyJS supports ES2015+ as of very recently — see [uglify-es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-es).*


## How?

The traditional approach to minification is this: parse your source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST) using something like [Acorn](https://github.com/ternjs/acorn), manipulate the AST, and finally generate code from it.

Butternut takes a different approach. It uses Acorn to generate an AST, but instead of steps 2 and 3 it then edits the code *in place* using [magic-string](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/magic-string) — which is much less costly than AST manipulation and code generation.


## Usage

The easiest way to use Butternut is to plug it into your existing build process:

* [rollup-plugin-butternut](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-butternut)
* [butternut-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/Apercu/butternut-webpack-plugin)
* [gulp-butternut](https://github.com/etsms/gulp-butternut)

Alternatively, you can use it directly via the CLI or the  API:


### Command Line Interface

Install Butternut globally, then use the `squash` command:

```bash
npm install --global butternut # or npm i -g butternut
squash app.js > app.min.js
```

Run `squash --help` to see the available options.


###  API

Install Butternut to your project...

```bash
npm install --save-dev butternut # or npm i -D butternut
```

...then use it like so:

```js
const butternut = require('butternut');
const { code, map } = butternut.squash(source, options);
```

The `options` argument, if supplied, is an object that can have the following properties:

| Option             | CLI equivalent  | Default value | Description                                                                                    |
|--------------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| check              | --check         | `false`       | Parse output. See [below](#the-check-option)                                                   |
| allowDangerousEval | n/a             | `false`       | Whether to allow direct `eval` calls                                                           |
| sourceMap          | -m, --sourcemap | `true`        | Whether to create a sourcemap. Set to `inline` to append to the output (not recommended)       |
| file               | n/a (automatic) | `null`        | The output filename, used in sourcemap generation                                              |
| source             | n/a (automatic) | `null`        | The source filename, used in sourcemap generation                                              |
| includeContent     | n/a             | `true`        | Whether to include the source file in the `sourcesContent` property of the generated sourcemap |


### The `check` option

Since Butternut is a new project, it hasn't yet been battle-tested. It *may* generate code that you don't expect. If you pass `check: true` (or use the `--check` flag, if using the CLI), Butternut will parse the generated output to verify that it is valid . If not, it means it's messed something up, in which case it will try to help you find the code that it failed to minify correctly.

If you find bugs while using Butternut, please raise an issue!

faceair/youjumpijump,Go,"# 微信跳一跳外挂

思路和原理参考 https://github.com/wangshub/wechat_jump_game [自动跳跃算法细节参考](https://github.com/faceair/wechat_jump_game/blob/master/wechat_jump.py#L50)

用 lang 重新实现是期望跨平台，方便打包给普通用户使用。代码逻辑精简过，运行速度会有提升。

## ⚠️ 警告

目前微信开始大规模进行反作弊，作弊严重的可能记录清零拉黑名单，手动游戏都无法记录成绩。目前还没有找到合理的反作弊方案，请慎重使用。也欢迎参与讨论 [#74](https://github.com/faceair/youjumpijump/issues/74) 。

## 下载地址

Android [下载地址](https://github.com/faceair/youjumpijump/releases/latest) 请下载 `youjumpijump-android` 单个文件，不要下载 `Source code`，Windows 用户可以尝试下载 Windows.zip 这个一键运行包（感谢群友 @  ♨﻿﻿Deloz.$ヽ. 、@MonFig 和 @tetsaicn 支持）。

iOS [下载地址](https://github.com/faceair/youjumpijump/releases/latest) 下载 `youjumpijump-ios` 单个文件即可。

## 使用须知

Android 设备

1. Android 手机一台，电脑上安装 ADB，连接上电脑后开启 USB 调试模式，开发者选项中有模拟触摸选项的请一并开启
2. 进入微信打开微信跳一跳，点击开始游戏
3. 将下载的文件 Push 到手机上 `adb push ./youjumpijump-android /data/local/tmp/ && adb shell`
4. 跑起来 `cd /data/local/tmp/ && chmod 775 ./youjumpijump-android || true && ./youjumpijump-android`
5. 可以开启开发者选项中的指针位置选项，每次跳动的时候会在屏幕上画一条线，可以判断程序每次的定位准不准

iOS 设备

1. 需要在 Mac 上安装配置 WebDriverAgent，参考[教程](https://testerhome.com/topics/7220)
2. 一切配置弄好后运行 `chmod 775 ./youjumpijump-ios && ./youjumpijump-ios`

## 跳跃系数

目前一般设备初始值可以设为 2.04，但如果设备的分辨率比较特殊，用默认的系数不能每次跳到中心点，可以微调一下系数争取每次都跳到中心点。但本程序的系数跟其他版本比如 python 的系数不一样，算法不一样，不要混淆。程序处理逻辑是会先将图片 resize 成宽度 720 像素的图片然后再找点和跳跃。

## FAQ

1. 怎么安装 ADB？怎么开启手机的 USB 调试？为什么电脑连不上手机？为什么我 Push 时说找不到文件？这些命令怎么执行？

请自行搜索解决，也可以尝试使用 [下载地址](https://github.com/faceair/youjumpijump/releases/latest) 中的 windows.zip 一键运行包，实在连不上可以[用模拟器](https://github.com/wangshub/wechat_jump_game/tree/master/%E6%96%B0%E6%89%8B%E5%B0%8F%E7%99%BD%E8%AF%B7%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E8%BF%99%E4%B8%AA%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%20%20%E4%B8%8D%E9%9C%80%E8%A6%81%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E7%9C%9F%E6%9C%BA%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%93%E7%94%A8%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81)（不保证安全性，自行承担风险）。

2. 程序执行输出了乱码？

Windows 在 CMD 字符编码不能显示中文，可以参考 [百度](https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=Windows%20ADB%20%E4%B9%B1%E7%A0%81) 设置解决。

3. 运行异常/第一下就飞了？

关大爆炸功能、关传送门、关悬浮球、运行时不能出现截图悬浮窗、关掉影响触摸和画面显示的相关功能。

4. 为什么要将文件 Push 到 Android 手机内执行？

我们发现会有偶尔的情况下定位的关键点都是准的，ADB 命令也执行了，但是就是没跳过去；有 MIUI 用户的截图被自动重命名了；也有朋友跑着跑着突然 ADB 报错了，无法继续执行了；同时也有朋友使用的电脑上的模拟器，非常的稳定。所以我们推测 ADB 命令在某些情况下会有问题，可能也跟连接的线材有关。所以我们决定将程序移植到 Android 上，直接在 Android 上运行。实验证明，确实稳定多了。

5. 怎么编译 Android 版本？

`CGO_ENABLED=0 GOARCH=arm GOOS=linux go build -o youjumpijump-android android/main.go`

6. 其他疑难杂症？

开新 issue 请并附上日志 `adb pull /data/local/tmp/debugger` 供我们排查。

Description
--------------

`SideMenuController` is a custom container view controller written in  which will display the main content within a center panel and the secondary content (option menu, navigation menu, etc.) within a side panel when triggered. The side panel can be displayed either on the left or on the right side, under or over the center panel.

 Installation 
--------------

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

CocoaPods 0.36 adds supports for  and embedded frameworks. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate `SideMenuController` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SideMenuController'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```


### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate `SideMenuController` into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github ""teodorpatras/SideMenuController""
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `SideMenuController.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use either of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate sources in the `Source` folder into your project manually.

 Supported OS & SDK Versions 
-----------------------------

* Supported build target - iOS 8.0+ (Xcode 7+)


 Usage 
--------------

You can get started using `SideMenuController` in 3 simple steps:

###Step 1
First of all, you should **add a menu button image** and **specify the position of the side panel**. Optionally, you can customise other preferences as well. This can be achieved in two ways:

### 1) If the SideMenuController subclass is the initial view controller in your main storyboard:

Subclass `SideMenuController` and override `init(coder:)` where you can change the preferences according to your own style:

```swift
class CustomSideMenuController: SideMenuController {

    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
        SideMenuController.preferences.drawing.menuButtonImage = UIImage(named: ""menu"")
        SideMenuController.preferences.drawing.sidePanelPosition = .overCenterPanelLeft
        SideMenuController.preferences.drawing.sidePanelWidth = 300
        SideMenuController.preferences.drawing.centerPanelShadow = true
        SideMenuController.preferences.animating.statusBarBehaviour = .showUnderlay
        super.init(coder: aDecoder)
    }
}
```

Next, go to the Storyboard, and change the class of the SideMenuController to the custom subclass you just created.

### 2) In all other cases:

In `AppDelegate.swift`, override `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`:

```swift
func func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Override point for customization after application launch.

    SideMenuController.preferences.drawing.menuButtonImage = UIImage(named: ""menu"")
    SideMenuController.preferences.drawing.sidePanelPosition = .overCenterPanelLeft
    SideMenuController.preferences.drawing.sidePanelWidth = 300
    SideMenuController.preferences.drawing.centerPanelShadow = true
    SideMenuController.preferences.animating.statusBarBehaviour = .showUnderlay
}
```
⚠️_If you **do not** specify a menu button image, `SideMenuController` **will not add one by default** and you will have to manually add one whenever transitioning to a new center view controller._

###Step 2
`SideMenuController` can be used with storyboard segues, or you can programmatically transition to a new center view controller.

####Using storyboard segues####

``SideMenuController`` defines two custom segues:
> - `SideContainmentSegue` - which transitions to a new side controller (triggers `embedSideController`)
> - `CenterContainmentSegue` - which transitions to a new center controller (triggers `embedCenterController`)

In the storyboard file, add initially two segues from the `SideMenuController` scene, one for the center view controller, and another for the side menu view controller. Later on, you can add more `CenterContainmentSeuges` depending on how many scenes you want to transition to.

Remember to set all the appropriate attributes of each segue in the Attributes Inspector:

| SideContainmentSegue   |      CenterContainmentSegue     |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| ![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teodorpatras/SideMenuController/master/assets/side_settings.png) |  ![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teodorpatras/SideMenuController/master/assets/center_settings.png) |

In order to embed the inital view controlles inside the `SideMenuController` you will have to call `performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:)`. Easiest way is to subclass `SideMenuController` and override `viewDidLoad`:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    performSegue(withIdentifier: ""embedInitialCenterController"", sender: nil)
    performSegue(withIdentifier: ""embedSideController"", sender: nil)
}
```

####Programmatically####

You can perform all the above mentioned transitions programmatically, without using segues, by calling one of the two public methods:

```swift
public func embed(sideViewController: UIViewController)
public func embed(centerViewController: UViewController)
```

**Important Note:** In case you want the center view controller to be of different type than `UINavigationController`, you'll have to add the menu button to one/all of its children navigation controllers programmatically. `SideMenuController` defines an extension to `UINavigationController` in order to make it easy to do that. Just call `navigationController.addSideMenuButton()`. **Before calling that method, make sure the navigation controller is already embedded inside the `SideMenuController`'s child controller hierarchy.**

Example with `UITabBarController`:

```swift
// create the view controllers for center containment
let vc1 = UIViewController()
vc1.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.red
vc1.title = ""first""
let nc1 = UINavigationController(rootViewController: vc1)
vc1.navigationItem.title = ""first""

let vc2 = UIViewController()
vc2.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.yellow
vc2.title = ""second""
let nc2 = UINavigationController(rootViewController: vc2)
vc2.navigationItem.title = ""second""

let vc3 = UIViewController()
vc3.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.blue
vc3.title = ""third""
let nc3 = UINavigationController(rootViewController: vc3)
vc3.navigationItem.title = ""third""

let tabBarController = UITabBarController()
tabBarController.viewControllers = [nc1, nc2, nc3]

// create the side controller
let sideController = UITableViewController()

// embed the side and center controllers
sideMenuViewController.embed(sideViewController: sideController)
sideMenuViewController.embed(centerViewController: tabBarController)

// add the menu button to each view controller embedded in the tab bar controller
[nc1, nc2, nc3].forEach({ controller in
  controller.addSideMenuButton()
})

show(sideMenuViewController, sender: nil)
```

###Step 3
You're almost set now. Last step is to know how to transition to new center view controllers.

**Important Note:** `SideMenuController` defines an extension to `UIViewController` in order to make it more accessible via the computed property `public var sideMenuController: SideMenuController?`. From any `UIViewController` instance, you can access the `SideMenuController` by typing: `self.sideMenuController`. This will return the `SideMenuController` if the caller is one of its child view controllers or otherwise `nil`.

From here onwards, whenever the user selects an option in the side menu controller, you can easily perform the segue like so:

####Using storyboard segues####

```swift
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
                            didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath)  {
	sideMenuController?.performSegue(withIdentifier: segues[indexPath.row], sender: nil)
}
```

####Programmatically####

```swift
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
                            didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath)  {
	sideMenuController?.embed(centerViewController: someUIViewControllerInstance)
}
```

 Caching 
--------------

`SideMenuController` offers you the possibility to cache center view controllers instead of always instantiating new ones when changing them.

**To transition to a new center view controller and cache it**, call ``embed(centerViewController:, cacheIdentifier:)`` on the ``SideMenuController``.

**To retrieve a cached center view controller based on a cache identifier**, call ``viewController(forCacheIdentifier:)`` on the ``SideMenuController``.

###Example

In your side view controller (a.k.a the menu controller):

```swift
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
                            didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath)  {

    // retrieve your identifier
    let cacheIdentifier = ...
    // retrieve your view controller
    let viewController = ...

    if let controller = sideMenuController?.viewController(forCacheIdentifier: cacheIdentifier) {
        sideMenuController?.embed(centerViewController: controller)
    } else {
        sideMenuController?.embed(centerViewController: UINavigationController(rootViewController: viewController), cacheIdentifier: cacheIdentifier)
    }
}
```

For a more detailed example, check the Example project.

 Customisation 
--------------
In order to customise the `SideMenuController` appearance and behaviour, you can play with the `SideMenuController .Preferences` structure. It is split into three sub structures:

* ```Drawing``` - encapsulates custom attributes specifying how ```SideMenuController``` will adjust its layout, positioning on screen.
* ```Animating``` - encapsulates custom attributes specifying which animations will be used for different components.
* ```Interaction``` - encapsulates custom attributes specifying how the user is allowed to interract with the side panel


| `Drawing` attribute   |      Description      |
|----------|-------------|------|
| `menuButtonImage` |    In case this attribute is set, `SideMenuController` will add a button on the left or right side of the navigation bar of the center view controller (**in case it is a subclass of UINavigationController**) in order to trigger the slide animation. If the attribute is missing, or the center view controller is not a subclass of `UINavigationController`, you'll have to add the menu button by yourself to all the `UINavigationControllers` that will be embedded.   |
| `sidePanelPosition` |  Specifies the positioning of the side panel. This attribute can take one of the four values:         `.underCenterPanelLeft`, `.underCenterPanelRight`, `.overCenterPanelLeft`, `.overCenterPanelRight` |
| `sidePanelWidth` | The width of the side panel. |
| `centerPanelOverlayColor` | When the side panel is either `.overCenterPanelLeft` or `.overCenterPanelRight`, an overlay will be shown on top of the center panel when the side is revealed. Pass the preferred color of this overlay. |
| `centerPanelShadow` | When the side panel is either `.underCenterPanelRight ` or `.underCenterPanelLeft` you can opt in or out to draw a side shadow for the center panel.  |

| `Animating` attribute   |      Description      |
|----------|-------------|------|
| `statusBarBehaviour` | The animating style of the status bar when the side panel is revealed. This can be:  **+** `.slideAnimation`: the status bar will be hidden using the `UIStatusBarAnimation.slide` animation **+** `.fadeAnimation`: the status bar will be hidden using the `UIStatusBarAnimation.fade` animation **+** `.horizontalPan`: the status bar will slide along with the center panel horizontally. **+** `.showUnderlay`: a layer with the same color as the navigation bar will be displayed under the status bar  |
| `reavealDuration` | Reveal animation duration. |
| `hideDuration` | Hide animation duration. |
| `transitionAnimator` | `TransitionAnimatable` subtype which defines how the new center view controller will be animated on screen. |

| `Interaction` attribute |      Description      | Discussion |
|----------|-------------|------|
| `panningEnabled` |  Default value is `true` | When the side panel is positioned **under the center panel**, the panning is recognized on the center panel. When the side panel is positoned **over the center panel**, the panning is recognized on the side panel. |
| `swipingEnabled` |  Default value is `true` | There is **no swipe gesture recognizer** instantiated when the side panel is positioned *under the center panel*. When the side panel is positioned **over the center panel**, the swipe is going to recognized on the center panel. |
| `menuButtonAccessibilityIdentifier` | Accessibility identifier to be set on the menu button. |

 Implementing custom transitions 
--------------

In order to implement custom transition animations for the center view controller, you have to create a `struct` that conforms to the `TransitionAnimatable` protocol and implement:
```static func performTransition(forView view: UIView, completion: () -> Void)```

Example:

```swift
public struct FadeAnimator: TransitionAnimatable {

##Public methods##
```swift
/**
 Toggles the side pannel visible or not.
*/
public func toggle()

/**
 Returns a view controller for the specified cache identifier

 - parameter identifier: cache identifier

 - returns: Cached UIViewController or nil
*/
public func viewController(forCacheIdentifier identifier: String) -> UIViewController?

/**
 Embeds a new side controller

 - parameter sideViewController: controller to be embedded
*/
public func embed(sideViewController controller: UIViewController)

/**
 Embeds a new center controller.

 - parameter centerViewController: controller to be embedded
 - parameter cacheIdentifier: identifier for the view controllers cache
*/
public func embed(centerViewController controller: UIViewController, cacheIdentifier: String? = nil)

```

##Public properties##

| Property   |      Type      | Description |
|----------|-------------|------|
|`preferences`| `SideMenuController.Preferences` | use to customise the `SideMenuController` preferences |
| `sidePanelVisible` | `Bool` | use to check at any time if the side panel is visible or not |
| `centerViewController` | `UIViewController` | use to access the currently embedded center view controller. |
| `sideViewController` | `UIViewController` | use to access the currently embedded side view controller. |
| `delegate` | `SideMenuControllerDelegate` | use to set the delegate to be notified about certain events. |

 Delegation 
--------------

`SideMenuController` defines a delegate protocol which you can use if you want to be announced when the side panel has been revealed or hidden:

```swift
public protocol SideMenuControllerDelegate: class {
    func sideMenuControllerDidHide(_ sideMenuController: SideMenuController)
    func sideMenuControllerDidReveal(_ sideMenuController: SideMenuController)
}
```

In order to receive the aforementioned callbacks, simply assign the delegate property to the `SideMenuController` instance.

Euler uses [custom operators in the ""Math Symbols""](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/LexicalStructure.html#ID418) character set to implement functions using traditional mathematical notation.

**Please keep in mind that this is not intended or recommended for production.** Custom operators of any breed are ripe for misuse and abuse, and should be used with as much care and caution as you would something like method swizzling or complex macros.

Euler is much better-suited to a Playground, where it could be used for teaching and learning logic and mathematics using a more vernacular notation.

> Euler is named after [Leonhard Euler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler), the Swiss mathematician credited for the popularization of modern mathematical notation such as the Greek letters `Σ` for summation & `π` for the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, the letters _`e`_ to denote the base of the natural logarithm & _`i`_ to denote the imaginary unit, `sin` & `cos` for trigonometric functions, and `f(x)` to denote the function `f` with argument `x`.

## Example Usage

```swift
import Foundation
import Euler
import PlaygroundSupport

𝑒 // 2.718281828459045

¬true // false

3 × 4 // 12

let prime = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
let fibonacci = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
prime ∩ fibonacci // {2, 3, 5}

∑[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] // 15

[1, 2] ⋅ [3, 4] // 11

7 ≠ 9 // true

var f: (Double) -> Double = sin
let g: (Double) -> Double = cos

for x in stride(from: 0, to: 4 * π, by: π / 8) {
    (f ∘ g)(x) // ∿∿∿
}

(f′)(π) // -1
```

jasonpolites/gesture-imageview,Java,"GestureImageView
================

This is a simple Android View class which provides basic pinch and zoom capability for images.

Can be used as a replacement for a standard ImageView when you want to include pinch and zoom.


UPDATE (Aug 2012)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just a quick note to all those who have posted issues recently, I HAVE seen them but just haven't had a chance
to fix them.  I'll do my best to get to them ASAP.  Thanks for being patient

Features:
~~~~~~~~~
1. Pinch zoom in place (i.e. zoom occurs from point of touch)
2. Panning with fling gesture
3. Double tap zoom
4. Configurable zoom boundaries (min/max)

Limitations:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Does not support Rotation
2. Does not support Pan and Zoom together
3. Not all methods of ImageView class are supported (will throw UnsupportedOperationException if strict is true)

What's New in the Latest Release!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added double-tap zoom support
- Added support for onClickListener
- Added support for non-image drawables

New in previous releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added support for CENTER, CENTER_INSIDE and CENTER_CROP scale types
- Added support for custom OnTouchListener on GestureImageView
- Fixed NPE when no drawable set on view
- Fixed/improved calculation of scale limits

Usage
~~~~~

Notes:
------
1. Setting gesture-image:strict to true will result in UnsupportedOperationException if an unsupported method is called.
2. Setting gesture-image:recycle to true will automatically reycle bitmap images when the view is destroyed.

Configured as View in layout.xml

ShingoFukuyama/WKWebViewTips,,"This is what I learned about `WKWebView`, Apple's new WebKit API debuted on iOS 8.

As of this writing, the latest iOS version is iOS 8.1.3.

## `file:///` doesn't work without `tmp` directory
Only the `tmp` directory access can be accessed with the `file:` scheme, as of iOS 8.0.2.

You can see what directory access is allowed on [the shazron / WKWebViewFIleUrlTest GitHut repo](https://github.com/shazron/WKWebViewFIleUrlTest).

Note: On iOS 9.0.0 (beta), you can use the below method to load files from Documents, Library and tmp folders. But App Bundle cannot.
`- (nullable WKNavigation *)loadFileURL:(NSURL *)URL allowingReadAccessToURL:(NSURL *)readAccessURL NS_AVAILABLE(10_11, 9_0);`

## Can't handle in Storyboard and Interface Builder
You need to set `WKWebView` and any `NSLayoutConstraint`s programmatically.

## HTML `` tag with `target=""_blank""` won't respond
See Stack Overflow: [Why is WKWebView not opening links with target=“_blank”](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25713069/why-is-wkwebview-not-opening-links-with-target-blank)


## URL Scheme and App Store links won't work

#### Example

```objc
// Using [bendytree/Objective-C-RegEx-Categories](https://github.com/bendytree/Objective-C-RegEx-Categories) to check URL String
#import ""RegExCategories.h""

- (void)webView:(WKWebView *)webView decidePolicyForNavigationAction:(WKNavigationAction *)navigationAction decisionHandler:(void (^)(WKNavigationActionPolicy))decisionHandler
{
    NSURL *url = navigationAction.request.URL;
    NSString *urlString = (url) ? url.absoluteString : @"""";

    // iTunes: App Store link
    if ([urlString isMatch:RX(@""\\/\\/itunes\\.apple\\.com\\/"")]) {
        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:url];
        decisionHandler(WKNavigationActionPolicyCancel);
        return;
    }
    // Protocol/URL-Scheme without http(s)
    else if (![urlString isMatch:[@""^https?:\\/\\/."" toRxIgnoreCase:YES]]) {
        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:url];
        decisionHandler(WKNavigationActionPolicyCancel);
        return;
    }
    decisionHandler(WKNavigationActionPolicyAllow);
}
```


## alert, confirm, prompt from JavaScript needs to set `WKUIDelegate` methods

If you want to show dialog boxes, you have to implement the following methods:

`webView:runJavaScriptAlertPanelWithMessage:initiatedByFrame:completionHandler:`
`webView:runJavaScriptConfirmPanelWithMessage:initiatedByFrame:completionHandler:`
`webView:runJavaScriptTextInputPanelWithPrompt:defaultText:initiatedByFrame:completionHandler:`

[Here is how to set those](http://qiita.com/ShingoFukuyama/items/5d97e6c62e3813d1ae98). 


## Basic/Digest/etc authentication input dialog boxes need to set a `WKNavigationDelegate` method

If you want to present an authentication challenge to user, you have to implement the method below:

`webView:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge:completionHandler:`

#### Example:

```objc

## Cookie sharing between multiple `WKWebView`s

Use a `WKProcessPool` to share cookies between web views.

#### Example:

```objc
self.processPool = [[WKProcessPool alloc] init];

WKWebViewConfiguration *configuration1 = [[WKWebViewConfiguration alloc] init];
configuration1.processPool = self.processPool;
WKWebView *webView1 = [[WKWebView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero configuration:configuration1];
...
WKWebViewConfiguration *configuration2 = [[WKWebViewConfiguration alloc] init];
configuration2.processPool = self.processPool;
WKWebView *webView2 = [[WKWebView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero configuration:configuration2];
...
```

See [this Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25797972/cookie-sharing-between-multiple-wkwebviews).


## Cannot work with `NSURLProtocol`, `NSCachedURLResponse`, `NSURLProtocol`
`UIWebView` can filter ad URLs and cache to read websites offline using `NSURLProtocol`, `NSURLCache`, and `NSCachedURLResponse`.

But `WKWebView` cannot work with those APIs.


## Cookie, Cache, Credential, WebKit data cannot easily delete

### iOS 8
After much trial and error, I've reached the following conclusion:

1. Use `NSURLCache` and `NSHTTPCookie` to delete cookies and caches in the same way as you used to do on `UIWebView`.
2. If you use `WKProccessPool`, re-initialize it.
3. Delete `Cookies`, `Caches`, `WebKit` subdirectories in the `Library` directory.
4. Delete all `WKWebView`s

### iOS 9

```objc
//// Optional data
NSSet *websiteDataTypes
= [NSSet setWithArray:@[
                        WKWebsiteDataTypeDiskCache,
                        WKWebsiteDataTypeOfflineWebApplicationCache,
                        WKWebsiteDataTypeMemoryCache,
                        WKWebsiteDataTypeLocalStorage,
                        WKWebsiteDataTypeCookies,
                        WKWebsiteDataTypeSessionStorage,
                        WKWebsiteDataTypeIndexedDBDatabases,
                        WKWebsiteDataTypeWebSQLDatabases
                        ]];
//// All kinds of data
//NSSet *websiteDataTypes = [WKWebsiteDataStore allWebsiteDataTypes];
//// Date from
NSDate *dateFrom = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSince1970:0];
//// Execute
[[WKWebsiteDataStore defaultDataStore] removeDataOfTypes:websiteDataTypes modifiedSince:dateFrom completionHandler:^{
   // Done
}];
```

Stack Overflow [How to remove cache in WKWebview?](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32491271/3283039)


## Scroll rate bug on iOS 9

On iOS 8, the below code works fine, it can scroll with more inertia.

`webView.scrollView.decelerationRate = UIScrollViewDecelerationRateNormal;`

As for iOS 9, this code is meaningless, without setting the rate value within UIScrollView delegate `scrollViewWillBeginDragging`.

```objc
- (void)scrollViewWillBeginDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView
{
    scrollView.decelerationRate = UIScrollViewDecelerationRateNormal;
}
```

See Stack Overflow: [Cannot change WKWebView's scroll rate on iOS 9](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31369538/cannot-change-wkwebviews-scroll-rate-on-ios-9-beta)


## Cannot disable long press link menu

CSS: `-webkit-touch-callout: none;` and JavaScript: `document.documentElement.style.webkitTouchCallout='none';` won't work.

Note: This bug was fixed in iOS 8.2.

## Sometimes capturing `WKWebView` fails

Sometimes capturing a screenshot of `WKWebView` itself failed, try to capture `WKWebView`'s `scrollView` property instead.

Otherwise, if you are not afraid of using private API, try [lemonmojo/WKWebView-Screenshot](https://github.com/lemonmojo/WKWebView-Screenshot).


## Xcode 6.1 and above doesn't indicate precise memory usage for WKWebView

As of Xcode 6.1, it indicates lower memory usage than is actually used.


## `window.webkit.messageHandlers` won't work on some websites
Some websites somehow override JavaScript's `window.webkit`. To prevent this issue, you should cache this to a variable before a website's content starts loading. `WKUserScriptInjectionTimeAtDocumentStart` can help you.


## Cookie saving sometimes failed
Are cookies synced between `NSHTTPCookie` and `WKWebView` at some point?

Thanks to @winzig, he gives me information: ""Cookie discussion / ajax #3""

See this Stack Overflow question: [Can I set the cookies to be used by a WKWebView?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26573137/can-i-set-the-cookies-to-be-used-by-a-wkwebview)

At `WKWebView` initialization time, it can set cookies to both cookie management areas without waiting for the areas to be synced.


## `WKWebView`'s `backForwardList` is readonly
I want `WKWebView` to restore its paging history.

## Hard to coexist with `UIWebView` on iOS 7 and below
Before some person tried to submit thier app for both iOS 7 and iOS 8 using `UIWebView` and `WKWebView`, the submission was rejected right at the time.

See this issue [Cannot coexist with UIWebView on iOS 7 and below](https://github.com/ShingoFukuyama/WKWebViewTips/issues/2)


## Links
[Naituw/WBWebViewConsole](https://github.com/Naituw/WBWebViewConsole)
""WBWebViewConsole is an In-App debug console for your UIWebView && WKWebView""


## Conclusion
As you can see, `WKWebView` still looks hard to use and UIWebView looks easy.

However, Apple announced to developers:

> Starting February 1, 2015, new iOS apps uploaded to the App Store must include 64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8 SDK, included in Xcode 6 or later.

It is possible Apple will make `UIWebView` deprecated. See [64-bit and iOS 8 Requirements for New Apps](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=10202014a).

Specifications
--------------

For the test, I decided to use an app that I actually work on: [eidolon](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon). Unlike most iOS apps, the project is stable and not under active development, so it's a prime candidate for accurate-ish benchmarking.

For ""fresh"" builds, I cleaned the build folder (⌘⇧K) repeatedly until it worked with no permissions problems. Then I sat and waited for Xcode to index the project. I also made sure the simulator (iPad Air 2) was _closed_, so these times include booting the simulator and launching the app. Each version of Xcode above should use the latest iOS version that it ships with. Then I hit ⌘R and start a timer, only ending it when the app had fully launched.

""Incremental"" builds represent a more common use case: changing one file and recompiling with the simulator already running. I added `print(""hello!"")` to `application(: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` and hit ⌘R, timing the time it took for the app to launch.

I repeated each test a few times and took their average times.

Contributing
------------

~It would be super-cool if we could perform the above tests on a variety of machines and consolidate the results here. Below are the instructions to download the code (compatible with Apple Silicon thanks to @pawelurb), and send a pull request adding your own results. I'd super-appreciate it! :bow:~

This repository is deprecated, but the results will stay around for posterity. [See below](#repo-status) for more.

```sh
git clone -b apple-silicon-compatibility https://github.com/artsy/eidolon.git
cd eidolon
bundle install
bundle exec fastlane oss
```

Repo Status
-----------

This repository was created in 2015 when I worked at [Artsy](https://artsy.net). The main project I worked on at the time ([Eidolon](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon)) was open source, making it an ideal test case for measuring Xcode compile times of real-world apps. However, [I stopped working at Artsy in 2021](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/leaving-artsy/) and Artsy is no longer maintaining Eidolon for compatibility with the latest versions of Swift, Xcode, CocoaPods, and open source dependencies.

I could continue maintaining the repo for Artsy, since Eidolon remains open source, but honestly, keeping this Xcode benchmarking repo maintained is a lot of work, and a [better repository exists](https://github.com/devMEremenko/XcodeBenchmark).

So at the end of 2021, I'm deprecating this repository. It was a hell of a ride. I'm grateful to Artsy for the opportunity to leverage their code for the good of the iOS developer community. And I'm most grateful to dozens of contributors who made this a valuable resource. Thank you, everyone.

## Basics

Working with, and understanding how, Toolkit is fairly easy as long as you keep the following in mind:

### Requirements

Toolkit is a Sass plugin available both as a Compass Extension or as Bower Package. To use, make sure you have [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) installed. Any Sass compiler that is feature-compatible with Sass 3.3 can be used with Toolkit, so feel free to use whatever you feel is best!

### Installation

To install as a Compass extension, add the following to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'toolkit', '~>2.0'
```

Then, add `require 'toolkit'` to your `config.rb` file and `@import ""toolkit"";` to your Sass file.

To install as a Bower package, run the following:

```bash
bower install sass-toolkit --save-dev
```

Even as an [Eyeglass](https://github.com/sass-eyeglass/eyeglass) module!

```bash
npm install sass-toolkit --save-dev
```

### Changing Settings

All of Toolkit's settings can be changed with a simple mixin. Whenever you would like to change a default, include the following mixin, and from then on out, whenever that default is needed, the value you've changed it to will be used:

```sass
@include toolkit-set('setting', value);
```

### Extends

Where appropriate, Toolkit mixins provide an `$extend` option to allow the shared output of a mixin to be set to an extendable class instead of duplicating the properties. Toolkit is super smart about this and will create the extendable class in place where you first call the mixin, allowing you to not worry about blowing up your cascade if you use it. All mixins that have an `extend` setting can have a portion of their mixin extended. By default, mixins won't extend, but you can change that by changing their global setting or by passing `$extend: true` to the mixin.

### Documentation Format

Each mixin/function definition looks like the following:

#### @include clearfix([$extend])

**Settings**

- `'clearfix extend': false`

Mixins start with `@include`, functions don't. Variables in [brackets] are optional. Settings are global setting variables that provide the defaults for optional variables, with their default.

## Art

Create pixel art using [ Box Shadows](http://sassmeister.com/gist/cf4a1eff8326585d66e6)! Simply write a string with `x` for where you'd like a pixel, and ` ` where you wouldn't. When you want a new line, simply write `\n`. The ""pixel"" size is the size of one pixel and doesn't have to be `px`. Border radius will apply to each ""pixel"", as will color.

#### @include art($art[, $px-size, $color, $radius])

- `'art pixel size': 1px`
- `'art color': black`
- `'art border radius': 0%`

## Clearfix

Use a clearfix to ensure a parent element that contains floated children encompasses its children. Toolkit's clearfix is a [modern clearfix](http://www.css-101.org/articles/clearfix/latest-new-clearfix-so-far.php).

#### @include clearfix([$extend])

**Settings**

- `'clearfix extend': false`

## Colors

Sass comes with a [slew of great color functions](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html), made even better by [color schemer](https://github.com/team-sass/color-schemer), but there are a few handy things missing to make working with groups of colors easier

### Tint and Shade

While Sass's built in `lighten` and `darken` functions are great if you're looking not to change the base color, they aren't what designers think of when they think of lightening or darkening a color. The mental model for those is actually mixing white or black to lighten or darken a color. So, like so many others, we have a `tint` and `shade` function that will do just that. Simply pass the color and the amount you want. For instance, if you wanted a red that was 25% lighter or darker than the standard  red, you'd do one of the followings:

#### @include tint($color, $amount)

**Settings**

- `'tint color': #fff`

#### @include shade($color, $amount)

**Settings**

- `'shade color': #000`

### Luma

[Luma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance_(video)) represented the brightness in an image (the ""black-and-white"" or achromatic portion of the image). As human vision is much more sensitive to luminance (""black and white"") than it is to chromatic differences (""colors""), luma provides an effective means of determining how a human will react to the relative brightness of a color. The Luma functions are based on the conversion to the [YIQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YIQ) color space, with Y being luma (also, the only component used in black-and-white televisions). The `luma` function provided will return the luma value for a color, and the additional helpers can be used for common tasks related to luma, such as if one color's luma is greater than and equal to or less than or equal to a second colors, and the difference between two colors' luma.

#### @include luma($color)

#### @include luma-gte($color1, $color2)

#### @include luma-lte($color1, $color2)

#### @include luma-diff($color1, $color2)


### Color Stacks

One technique for working with color that is very useful is to create color stacks that get either lighter or darker as they go, allowing me to easily create full color pallets with only a handful of base colors and then only needing to remember those base colors. These are called color stacks, and making them with Toolkit is super easy. A sample color stack, if written by hand, may look something like the following:

```scss
$red: red, #ff3f3f, #ff7f7f, #ffbfbf, #ffd8d8, #fff2f2;
```

This is a color stack for red that gets tinted as it goes (25%, 50%, 75%, 85%, 90%). To make figuring these out easier, there is the `color-stack` function that takes two required parameters, the main color you want to use and the secondary color you want to use (in the case of shading red, the main color would be red and the secondary color would be black), and a variable number of arguments of what percent you want them mixed. Tint stacks, shade stacks, and tint to shade stacks are also available.

#### @include color-shade($main, $secondary [, $amounts...])

**Settings**

- `'color stack amounts': 25% 50% 75% 85% 90%`

#### @include tint-stack($main [, $amounts...])

**Settings**

- `'tint color': #fff`
- `'color stack amounts': 25% 50% 75% 85% 90%`

#### @include shade-stack($main [, $amounts...])

**Settings**

- `'shade color': #000`
- `'color stack amounts': 25% 50% 75% 85% 90%`

#### @include tint-shade-stack($main [, $amounts...])

**Settings**

- `'tint color': 75% 50% 25%`
- `'shade color': #000`
- `'tint shade amounts': 75% 50% 25%`

### Color Scales

Color scales allow you to step from one color to another in even steps. Color scale will scale your first color to your second color evenly by hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha. Hue will take the fastest path around the color wheel

#### @include color-scale($main, $secondary [, $steps...])

**Settings**

- `'color scale steps': 6`

## DRY Mixins

The pattern that inspired the [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/) article [DRY-ing Out Your Sass Mixins](http://alistapart.com/article/dry-ing-out-your-sass-mixins), now available for you to use in your projects! The full writeup on the why can be found in the article, and examples can be found all throughout Toolkit.

#### @include dynamic-extend($id) { @content }

The `dynamic-extend` mixin is the core mixin for dynamically creating placeholder selectors and extending them directly.

#### @include mixin-dryer($id [,$extend: true]) { @content }

The `mixin-dryer` mixin is a one-stop-shop mixin for working with the whole pattern. It wraps the contents of the **static** portion of the pattern into a single mixin. If you don't think someone would want to use the static mixin on its own, simply drop `mixin-dryer` into your core mixin and you're good to go! The button example from A List Apart can be written with this mixin as follows:

```scss
@mixin button($color, $extend: true) {
  background-color: $color;
  border-color: mix(black, $color, 25%);

  &:hover {
    background-color: mix(black, $color, 15%);
    border-color: mix($black, $color, 40%);
  }

  @include mixin-dryer('button', $extend) {
    border: 1px solid;
    border-radius: 5px;
    padding: .25em .5em;

    &:hover {
      cursor: pointer;
    }
  }
}
```

## Font Helpers

Web fonts are absolutely awesome, but working with them can be a bit tricky. Ligatures are super powerful and make fonts that that support them even more beautiful, but aren't on by default. Webfonts are awesome, but you need to wait for them to download and that can cause a Flash of Unstyled Text, which can be jarring and unpleasant. Toolkit provides some tools to ease this.

### Enable Ligatures

A simple mixin to enable ligatures

#### @include enable-ligatures([$extend])

**Settings**

- `'ligature extend': false`

### Font Face

A mixin to make writing `@font-face` declarations easy. `$files` should be a map where the key is the file extensions and the value is the path. If using Compass, paths should be relative to your font directory (`fonts_dir` in `config.rb`). If Compass is available, this mixin can inline the `woff` file, thus caching it with your 

#### @include font-face($name, $files [, $weight, $style, $inline-woff])

**Settings**

- `'font face weight': normal`
- `'font face style': normal`
- `'font face inline woff': false`

### Icon Font

A mixin for applying a core set of styling for icon fonts, based on styling form fonts generated by [Icomoon](http://icomoon.io). Setting `$speak: false` will optionally apply the [`speak: none`](http://webdesign.about.com/od/styleproperties/p/blspspeak.htm) property.

#### @include icon-font($font-stack, [, $speak, $extend])

**Settings**

- `'icon font speak': false`
- `'icon font extend': false`

### Content Fade In

One of the big challenges of working with webfonts is the Flash of Unstyled Text. It happens when webfonts get applied after content is already rendered on the page, usually causing a jarring jump when they are. To help combat this, Google and Typekit teamed up to create [WebFont Loader](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/webfont_loader), a JavaScript library to add Font Events that you can hook in to using  and JavaScript to know whether your webfonts are loading, have successfully loaded, or have failed to load. As [Typekit](http://help.typekit.com/customer/portal/articles/6852) suggests, these can be utilized to more effectively take control over your staying and prevent FOUT. The `content-fade-in` mixin will set your content to a 0 opacity (allowing the page to paint correctly even while it's not visible) and when a loading class has been removed, will fade your content in to an opacity of 1.

#### @include content-fade-in([$duration, $loading, $extend])

**Settings**

- `'fade in duration': 1s`
- `'fade in loading class': '.wf-loading'`
- `'fade in extend': false`

## Intrinsic Ratios

What is an intrinsic ratio you may ask? Well Thierry Koblentz wrote a great [A List Apart article](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/creating-intrinsic-ratios-for-video/) explaining it all in great detail; go read it. In a nutshell, however, it's a way to force any child elements to fluidly scale at a given ratio, including videos and frames, making awesome responsive happiness. If you just want to change the ratio, use the `intrinsic-ratio-ratio` mixin.

#### @include intrinsic-ratio([$ratio, $width, $elements, $position, $extend])
#### @include ir([$ratio, $width, $elements, $position, $extend])

**Settings**

- `'intrinsic ratio': 16/9`
- `'intrinsic ratio width': 100%`
- `'intrinsic ratio elements': '> *'`
- `'intrinsic ratio position': top`
- `'intrinsic ratio extend': false`

#### @include intrinsic-ratio-ratio([$ratio, $width, $position])
#### @include ir-ratio([$ratio, $width, $position])

**Settings**

- `'intrinsic ratio': 16/9`
- `'intrinsic ratio width': 100%`
- `'intrinsic ratio position': top`

## Kickstart

Importing the kickstart partial with `@import ""toolkit/kickstart"";` will add the following common styles to your project:

```scss
html {
  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
       box-sizing: border-box;
}

*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}

embed,
img,
object,
video {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

## Nested Context

Sometimes we may be inside of an element but need something the width of its parent.

![Basic nested context](http://img.pgdn.us/nested-context.png)

This is easy with fixed widths because then we can just make the child the width we want it but percentages change with each new context. With just a little bit of math we can pretty easily figure out what context we are in and it is condensed in the `nested-context()` function. Simply write how wide your current container is and it will figure out how wide it’s parent is like `nested-context(30%)` will give you a percentage to match the parent. Sometimes you are multiple levels deep and in that case, you can just list the levels `nested-context(80% 60% 33%)` and result in a percentage matching that of the 3rd parent up. See the [nested context](http://codepen.io/scottkellum/pen/vGuaI) and [centered nested context](http://codepen.io/scottkellum/pen/mwlGe) examples.

#### nested-context([$contexts])

**Settings**

- `'nested context contexts': 100%`

#### @include nested-context([$contexts, $position])

**Settings**

- `'nested context contexts': 100%`
- `'nested context position': left`

## Parallax

The concept of the parallax effect is simple, things closer to the viewer move faster while things further away move slower. Leveraging 3D transforms, this effect can be implemented without any JavaScript. You need to initialize your parallax container before being able to parallax an item. By default iOS parallax is on but setting it to false will turn on smooth scrolling within that element and no parallax effect will be shown.

The parallax mixin puts elements into real perspective and scales them back down to 100% so images and text will not have any distortion. Items will shift both vertically and horizontally in layouts to achieve the appropriate perspective. With `@include init()`, if `$element: this`, the current element will be initialized; if `$element: '.class'|'#id'`, the respective element will be placed at the root of the stylesheet (not nested under the current selector). `@include init()` can be called from the root of your stylesheet.

#### @include parallax-init([$perspective, $element, $parallax-ios])

**Settings**

- `'parallax perspective': 1`
- `'parallax element': 'body'`
- `'parallax ios': true`

#### @include parallax([$distance, $perspective])

**Settings**

- `'parallax perspective': 1`
- `'parallax distance': 0`

## Reset

Importing the reset partial with `@import ""toolkit/reset"";` will add a  Reset in based on work done by [Nicholas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), [Richard Clark](http://richclarkdesign.com), and [Tim Murtaugh](http://monkeydo.biz/), and some other things that are useful. Also includes the [kickstart](#kickstart).

## RTL

Quickly and easily write your left-to-right and right-to-left properties with one mixin! Works for `*-left` and `*-right` properties, as well as shorthand syntaxes.

#### @include rtl($property, $value)

## Settings

While the standard `$variable: value !default` for allowing users the ability to change defaults in a system is okay, it can become cumbersome quickly. Cascading user changes is hard, doesn't always work as expected, and for large systems all of those settings pollute the global namespace. These setting functions and mixins make it easy to work with setting in the same way that [Toolkit does](#changing-settings). We're even dogfooding here, using these internally to work with Toolkit's settings! And none of our tests broke when we made the transition!

### User Setting Exists

Used to see if a user has set a setting. Will return `true` or `false`.

#### user-setting-exists($setting)

Pass in a comma separated list of user settings you would like to test. Will return a map where the keys are the settings and the values are their respective state.

#### user-setting-exists-multiple($settings...)

### Setting Get

Used to retrieve a setting. Will attempt to find the user setting first, and if a user hasn't set a value for that setting, will use the default setting. Returns the value of the setting

#### setting-get($setting)

Pass in a comma separated list of user settings you would like to retrieve. Will return a map where the keys are the settings and the values are their respective values.

#### setting-get-multiple($setting...)

### Setting Set

Used to set a setting. Returns `true`. The function and the mixins take the same input.

#### setting-set($setting, $value)

#### @include setting-set($setting, $value)

#### @include setting-change($setting, $value)

Used to set multiple settings at once. The input should be a map where the key is the setting and the value is the value of said setting.

#### setting-set-multiple($settings)

#### @include setting-set-multiple($settings)

#### @include setting-change-multiple($settings)

### Setting Clear

Used to clear a single user setting. Will return `true`. The function and the mixins take the same input.

#### setting-clear($setting)

#### @include setting-clear($setting)

Pass in a comma separated list of user settings you would like to clear. Will return `true`. The function and the mixins take the same input.

#### setting-clear-multiple($settings...)

#### @include setting-clear-multiple($settings...)

Used to clear all user settings. Will return `true`. The function and the mixins take the same input.

#### setting-reset()

#### @include setting-reset()

### Setting Pick

The most common usecase of actually needing to determine the setting to use is within a custom function or mixin. The recommended way of doing this is to provide a default value of `null` for arguments that are controlled by settings, then check to see if that value is `null` and, if not, get the correct setting. The setting pick functions do this.

#### setting-pick($setting, $input)

Used to pick multiple settings at once. The input should be a map where the key is the setting and the value is the input to be tested. Will return a map where the keys are the setting and the value is the determined value.

#### setting-pick-multiple($settings)

```scss
@mixin button($size, $color: null) {
  $color: setting-pick('button color', $color);
  // ... rest of stuff goes here
}
```

### Setting Defaults

Congratulations! You now have an API for working with setting that you didn't need to write! Awesome! But how do you actually make global settings to use? Well, simple. Create a map of your settings, the keys being the setting name, the values being the value of the setting, and merge it into the `$GlobalSettings` variable. This will put them in the global setting namespace. If you would like your variables namespaced, it's recommended that you write wrapper functions for the setting functions for your plugin.

```scss
@import ""toolkit"";

$MyAwesomePluginSettings: (
  'button color': #b4d455,
  'mug fill color': #c0ffee
);

$GlobalSettings: map-merge($GlobalSettings, $MyAwesomePluginSettings);

// ... The rest of your awesome plugin stuff here
```


## Triangles

You love em! Triangles! Now create them using just ! Turn any element or pseudo element into a triangle just by using the `@include triangle;`. It's perfect for flags, speech bubbles, and arrows.

Width and height just stretch the triangle to match a width or height. You can use any units you want although percentages don't work so well. Angle is where the  point of the triangle is drawn opposing one side. This is a little diffucult to explain, so here is a gif. If the width and height are not uniform, then the angle will be stretched to match the triangles proportions. The mixin also supports keywords like `top`, `top right`, `right` and so on for the angle. The triangle will point in the direction you give it.

![triangle](http://img.pgdn.us/triangle2.gif)

![triangle example](http://img.pgdn.us/triangle-ex.png)

#### @include triangle([$color, $height, $width, $angle])

**Settings**

- `'triangle color': #000`
- `'triangle height': 1em`
- `'triangle width': 1em`
- `'triangle angle': 0`

## Center

> We can do [insert seemingly impossible thing here] but we can't even center with 
>
> *Unfunny people on the Internet*

Yes, Flexbox will give us a native way to center things when it finally arrives, but until then, and for all of the browsers that don't support Flexbox, a few handy mixins for centering vertically, horizontally, or both!


### Vertical Center

Vertical center anything, literally anything, with the `vertical-center` mixin. Based on [Sebastian Ekström’s vertical align technique](http://zerosixthree.se/vertical-align-anything-with-just-3-lines-of-css/).

#### @include vertical-center([$midpoint, $extend])

**Settings**

- `'vertical midpoint': 50%`
- `'vertical extend': false`

### Horizontal Center

Horizontal center anything, literally anything, with the `horizontal-center` mixin. Based on [Sebastian Ekström’s vertical align technique](http://zerosixthree.se/vertical-align-anything-with-just-3-lines-of-css/) for fixed position items and good 'ol `margin: 0 auto` for everything else.

#### @include horizontal-center([$midpoint, $fixed, $extend])

**Settings**

- `'horizontal fixed': false` (fixed position item)
- `'horizontal extend': false`
- `'horizontal midpoint': 0%`
- `'horizontal fixed midpoint': 50%` (midpoint for fixed position item)

### Absolute Center

I want it in the middle. The absolute middle. The middle of the middle of the middle. The absolute middle of the middle of the middle of the middle.

#### @include absolute-center([$vertical, $horizontal, $fixed, $extend])

**Settings**

- `'absolute center fixed': false` (fixed position item)
- `'absolute center extend': false`
- `'absolute center vertical midpoint': 50%`
- `'absolute center fixed horizontal': 0%` 
- `'absolute center fixed horizontal midpoint': 50%` (horizontal midpoint for fixed position item)

## Viewport

Currently in the Draft stage, but being implemented by Microsoft is the  directive [`@viewport`](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-device-adapt/#the-atviewport-rule). This mixin simply provides prefixing.

#### @include viewport { @content }

## Underline

Create beautiful underlines [à la Medium](https://medium.com/designing-medium/7c03a9274f9)! Now with the ability to clear descenders!

#### @include underline([$background, $color, $clear-descenders, $distance, $width])

**Settings**

- `'underline background': #f00`
- `'underline color': #00e`
- `'underline clear descenders': true`
- `'underline distance': 1` (unitless number)
- `'underline width': 2` (unitless number)
- `'underline extend': false`

## Target

Creates specially formatted comments for use with [gulp-css-target](https://github.com/snugug/gulp-css-target)

#### @include target($target) { @content }

## Set Multiple

Applies the same property to multiple values.

#### @include set-multiple($value, $property-list);

```scss
  .box {
    @include set-multiple(50%, width height);
  }
```

```css
  .box {
    width: 50%;
    height: 50%;
  }
```

# DCPathButton 

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/Tangdixi/DCPathButton.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Tangdixi/DCPathButton)

![Foled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tangdixi/DCPathButton/master/ScreenShot/1.png)
![Bloom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tangdixi/DCPathButton/master/ScreenShot/2.png) 

**DCPathButton** is a custom menu button for iOS. The original design for this control first appeared in the well-known iOS app, [**Path**](www.path.com). Starting in **Path 4.0**, this beautiful button appeared in the tab bar, with a new design. The **DCPathButton** is a close replication of Path's button, including the **animations**, the **sounds** and the **button's images** (*of course you can use your own images*).  

## Swift Version

Working on Swift Version now. It need some times ...

## How To Get Started  

- Download [**DCPathButton**](https://codeload.github.com/Tangdixi/DCPathButton/zip/master)
- Clone **DCPathButton**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Tangdixi/DCPathButton.git
```

## Installation

You can install **DCPathButton** in a traditional way -- drag the **DCPathButton** folder into your project. However, it is strongly recommended that you install via **CocoaPods**.

#### Requirements

- **AudioToolBox.framework**
- **QuartzCore.framework**

## Install with CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for  and Swift, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like **DCPathButton** in your projects.

#### Podfile
```bash
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod 'DCPathButton', '~> 2.1.3'
``` 

## Usage

#### Create a DCPathButton  

1.import the ""DCPathButton"" to your controller
```objc
import ""DCPathButton.h""
```  
2.Add the `DCPathButtonDelegate` to your controller  
```objc
@interface ViewController ()
```
3.Create a center button and add it into your view
```objc
DCPathButton *centerButton = [[DCPathButton alloc]initWithCenterImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""chooser-button-tab""]
                                                      hilightedImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""chooser-button-tab-highlighted""]];
[self.view addSubView:centerButton];
```
4.Create some item buttons and add them to the center button

```objc
DCPathItemButton *itemButton_1 = [[DCPathItemButton alloc]initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""image""]
                                                       highlightedImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""highlightedImage""]
                                                        backgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""backgroundImage""]
                                             backgroundHighlightedImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""backgroundhighlightedImage""]];

[centerButton addPathItems:@[itemButton_1]];                                                 
```
------

#### DCPathButtonDelegate

`` handle the action when you fire the item buttons which is similar to the **UITableViewDelegate**, control the items through the **index**  

You can add a minimum of one item or a maximum of five items. The `itemButtonIndex` parameter is  Assuming we have five items, so the **itemButtonIndex** is 0 to 4.

```objc
- (void)pathButton:(DCPathButton *)dcPathButton clickItemButtonAtIndex:(NSUInteger)itemButtonIndex {
    NSLog(@""You tap %@ at index : %lu"", dcPathButton, (unsigned long)itemButtonIndex);
}
```

You also can do something before or when the item buttons appear:

```objc
- (void)willPresentItemButton {
    
    NSLog(@""ItemButton will present"");
    
}
- (void)didPresentItemButton {

    NSLog(@""ItemButton did present"");
    
}
```

------

## Custom Properties

```objc
@property (assign, nonatomic) CGFloat bloomRadius;
```

`bloomRadius` is used to handle the item button bloom radius. The default value is `105.0f`.

------

```objc
@property (assign, nonatomic) CGPoint dcButtonCenter;
```

`dcButtonCenter` is used to modify the center button's position.  The default value positions the **DCPathButton** in bottom center.  

------

```objc
@property (assign, nonatomic) BOOL allowSounds;
```

`allowSounds ` is used to enable the button's sound. The default value is `YES`.

------

```objc
@property (copy, nonatomic) NSString *bloomSoundPath;
@property (copy, nonatomic) NSString *foldSoundPath;
@property (copy, nonatomic) NSString *itemSoundPath;
```
You can change the button's sound by specifying the path of a custom sound file, for instance:

```objc
self.bloomSoundPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""bloom"" ofType:@""caf""];
```

------

```objc
@property (assign, nonatomic) kDCPathButtonBloomDirection bloomDirection;
```
There are `9` directions in **DCPathButton**, use the `bloomDirection` property to change the direction. All the directions are defined in the `NS_ENUM` below:

```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSUInteger, kDCPathButtonBloomDirection) {
    
    kDCPathButtonBloomDirectionTop = 1,
    kDCPathButtonBloomDirectionTopLeft = 2,
    kDCPathButtonBloomDirectionLeft = 3,
    kDCPathButtonBloomDirectionBottomLeft = 4,
    kDCPathButtonBloomDirectionBottom = 5,
    kDCPathButtonBloomDirectionBottomRight = 6,
    kDCPathButtonBloomDirectionRight = 7,
    kDCPathButtonBloomDirectionTopRight = 8,
    kDCPathButtonBloomDirectionCenter = 9,
    
};
```
------

```objc
@property (assign, nonatomic) CGFloat bloomAngel;
```
`bloomAngel` is used for changing the item button's bloom angle. 

------

```objc
@property (assign, nonatomic) BOOL allowSubItemRotation;
```
`allowSubItemRotation ` is used for handling the rotation of the subItems.

------

```objc
@property (assign, nonatomic) NSTimeInterval basicDuration;
```
`basicDuration ` is used for changing the bloom animation's duration / speed.

## Swift Example

A Swift version of the project is coming. For now refer to the included Swift example to understand how you might integrate this project into your own Swift app.

l20n/l20n.js,JavaScript,"L20n: Localization 2.0 (Deprecated)
===================================

__L20n.js has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. Please use
[Fluent][], the successor to L20n developed by the same team at Mozilla.
Fluent is a mature localization system currently used in Firefox and in many
other Mozilla projects.__

---

L20n is an opinionated localization library for the Web. It builds on top of
[Fluent][] which was designed to unleash the expressive power of the natural
language.

L20n.js is a good choice for websites which want to offer a best-in-class
translation experience for their users.  L20n takes advantage of modern web
technologies to offer a fast and lean localization of HTML and .

[Fluent]: http://projectfluent.org


How to use L20n
---------------

Include the following code in the `` section of your HTML:

```html




```
Use the `data-l10n-id` attribute on an HTML element to mark it as localizable.

```html

```

That's it!  L20n will set up a `MutationObserver` and will make sure the
element is localized even if the DOM changes.  See [docs/html][] for more
information.

[docs/html]: https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/blob/master/docs/html.md

It is also possible to use L20n programmatically, for instance in order to 
localize dynamic content.  The API is exposed under `document.l10n`.  Refer to
the [docs/][] directory for more details.

[docs/]: https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/blob/master/docs/


Learn the FTL syntax
--------------------

L20n uses Project Fluent under the hood.  FTL is a localization file format
used for describing translation resources.  FTL stands for _Fluent Translation
List_.

FTL is designed to be simple to read, but at the same time allows to represent
complex concepts from natural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations,
and others.

    hello-user = Hello, { $username }!

[Read the Fluent Syntax Guide][] in order to learn more about the syntax.  If
you're a tool author you may be interested in the formal [EBNF grammar][].

## What are Traits?
_**Traits**_ allows you to modify the design and behavior of native iOS apps without having to restart them, even across the globe.

Wouldn't it be great if we could adjust designs of our native apps without having to sit back to Xcode, change code, recompile and navigate back to the screen we were at?

**Traits** is a library that provides you the ability to change many properties of your apps (not only design) without having to recompile the application, even via network across the globe.

Using it offers many benefits:

- Immediate feedback
- Ability to update running applications remotely
- Requires almost no code changes in your app
- Both Code and Interface Builder designs are supported
- Can tweak more than just UI
- Fully tested
- Supports [code injection and real-time programming](http://johnholdsworth.com/injection.html)

![Gif](Images/demo.gif)

[Article describing design and implementation details of this tool](http://merowing.info/2017/01/how-hard-would-it-be-to-adjust-your-ios-app-in-real-time/)

## Usage

#### 1. Add the library into your project
#### 2. Assign proper view identifiers either via code:
```swift
view.traitSpec = ""article.containerView""
```

or via interface builder:

![IBInspectable demo](Images/interface-builder.png)

#### 3. [Optional] If you want live-reloading:

While running on simulator you can observe file on your desktop:
```swift
TraitsProvider.setupDesktopDaemon()
```

While running on device, you can observe remote URL:
```swift
TraitsProvider.setupRemoteDaemon(url: myFileURL)
```

## Extending

`Traits` supports extending the library in real-time, without even having to recompile your project and **without unsigning your Xcode 8**.

Just install [Injection app](http://johnholdsworth.com/injection.html) and code away:

![Gif](Images/realtime.gif)


Adding new `Trait` that is specific to your project is really simple:

1. Create a new subclass of `Trait`
2. Declares the target types that are supported.
3. Provide `apply` function that returns a reversal closure
4. Declare data mapping using `ObjectMapper`
5. Compile. (or code inject as we support that as well)

```swift
final public class Constraint: Trait {
    private(set) var constant: CGFloat?

    open override class var restrictedTypes: [AnyClass]? { return [NSLayoutConstraint.self] }

    open override func apply(to target: Trait.Target, remove: inout RemoveClosure) throws {
        let target = target as! NSLayoutConstraint

        remove = { [weak target, constant = target.constant] in
            guard let target = target else { return }
            target.constant = constant
        }

        if let constant = constant {
            target.constant = constant
        }
    }

    public init(constant: CGFloat) {
        super.init()
        self.constant = constant
    }

    public required init?(map: Map) {
        super.init(map: map)
    }

    open override func mapping(map: Map) {
        super.mapping(map: map)
        constant <- map[""constant""]
    }
}
```


## Requirements
This library requires a deployment target of iOS 8.0 or greater.

## Installation

Traits is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).

To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod ""Traits""
```

autresphere/ASMediaFocusManager,Objective-C,"## ASMediaFocusManager
ASMediaFocusManager gives the ability to focus on any thumbnail image or video by a simple tap. The thumbnail image is automatically animated to a focused fullscreen image view or video player. Another tap on the 'Done' button shrinks (or defocuses) the image back to its initial position.

Each thumbnail image view may have its own transform, the focus and defocus animations take care of any initial transform.

Works on iPhone and iPad.


by MacBuildServer


![](https://github.com/autresphere/ASMediaFocusManager/raw/master/Screenshots/video.gif) 

## Video
A video player is shown if the media is a video (supported extension are ""mp4"" and ""mov""). The video player comes with its own controls made of a play/pause button, a slider and time labels. Scrubbing is also available thanks to [ASBPlayerScrubbing](https://github.com/autresphere/ASBPlayerScrubbing).

![](https://github.com/autresphere/ASMediaFocusManager/raw/master/Screenshots/videoPlayer.jpg) 
![](https://github.com/autresphere/ASMediaFocusManager/raw/master/Screenshots/videoFocusOnVideo.gif)

## Orientation
The focused view is automatically adapted to the screen orientation even if your main view controller is portrait only.

Because orientation management was different on iOS 5, this class does not work on iOS 5 and below (although it should not be hard to adapt it).

## Image content modes
For now, only `UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFit` and `UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill` are supported, but these modes are the most widely used.

In case of `UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill`, the view is expanded in order to show the image in full.

![](https://github.com/autresphere/ASMediaFocusManager/raw/master/Screenshots/videoAspectFill.gif) 

If you want other content modes to be supported, please drop me a line. You can even try a pull request, which would be much appreciated!

## Image size
When focused, an image is shown fullscreen even if the image is smaller than the screen resolution. In this case no interactive zoom is available.

All Image sizes are supported.

## Exemple Project
See the contained example to get a sample of how `ASMediaFocusManager` can easily be integrated in your project.

To build the example, you first need to run `pod install` from the `Example` directory.

## Use It
The prefered way to integrate `ASMediaFocusManager` is through cocoapods as it is dependent on another pod for the video feature. Add `pod 'ASMediaFocusManager'` to your Podfile.

You can also copy the whole `ASMediaFocusManager` folder in your project, as well as `ASBPlayerScrubbing`.

Then in your project:

* Create a `ASMediaFocusManager`
* Implement its delegate `ASMediasFocusDelegate`.
The delegate returns mainly a media URL, a media title and a parent view controller. 
* Declare all your views that you want to be focusable by calling `[ASMediaFocusManager installOnViews:]`

### Implementing
In your View Controller where some image views need focus feature, add this code.

```objc
- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    
    self.mediaFocusManager = [[ASMediaFocusManager alloc] init];
    self.mediaFocusManager.delegate = self;
    // Tells which views need to be focusable. You can put your image views in an array and give it to the focus manager.
    [self.mediaFocusManager installOnViews:self.imageViews];
}
```

Here is an example of a delegate implementation. Please adapt the code to your context.
```objc

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    ...
    self.mediaNames = @[@""1f.jpg"", @""2f.jpg"", @""3f.mp4"", @""4f.jpg""];
    ...
}

#pragma mark - ASMediasFocusDelegate
// Returns the view controller in which the focus controller is going to be added.
// This can be any view controller, full screen or not.
- (UIViewController *)parentViewControllerForMediaFocusManager:(ASMediaFocusManager *)mediaFocusManager
{
    return self.parentViewController;
}

// Returns the URL where the media (image or video) is stored. The URL may be local (file://) or distant (http://).
- (NSURL *)mediaFocusManager:(ASMediaFocusManager *)mediaFocusManager mediaURLForView:(UIView *)view
{
    NSInteger index;
    NSString *name;
    NSURL *url;

    // Here, medias are accessed through their name stored in self.mediaNames
    index = [self.imageViews indexOfObject:view];
    name = self.mediaNames[index];    
    url = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:name withExtension:nil];
    
    return url;
}

// Returns the title for this media view. Return nil if you don't want any title to appear.
- (NSString *)mediaFocusManager:(ASMediaFocusManager *)mediaFocusManager titleForView:(UIView *)view
{
	return @""My title"";
}


```

If you need to focus or defocus a view programmatically, you can call `startFocusingView` ()as long as the view is focusable) or `endFocusing`.

```objc
[self.mediaFocusManager startFocusingView:mediaView];
```

### Properties
```objc
@property (nonatomic, assign) NSTimeInterval animationDuration;
```
The animation duration. Defaults to 0.5.
```objc
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *backgroundColor;
```
The background color. Defaults to transparent black.
```objc
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL defocusOnVerticalSwipe;
```
Enables defocus on vertical swipe. Defaults to YES.
```objc
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL elasticAnimation;
```
Returns whether the animation has an elastic effect. Defaults to YES.
```objc
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL zoomEnabled;
```
Returns whether zoom is enabled on fullscreen image. Defaults to YES.
```objc
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL gestureDisabledDuringZooming;
```
Returns whether gesture is disabled during zooming. Defaults to YES.
```objc
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL isDefocusingWithTap;
```
Returns whether defocus is enabled with a tap on view. Defaults to NO.
```objc
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL addPlayIconOnVideo;
```
Returns wheter a play icon is automatically added to video thumbnails. Defaults to YES.
```objc
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIImage *playImage;
```
Image used to show a play icon on video thumbnails. Defaults to nil (uses internal image).
```objc
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIViewController *topAccessoryController;
```
Controller used to show custom accessories. If none is specified a default controller is used with a simple close button.

### Hiding the status bar
On iOS 7, if you want to hide or show the status bar when a view is focused or defocused, you can use optional delegate methods `[ASMediaFocusManager mediaFocusManagerWillAppear:]` and `[ASMediaFocusManager mediaFocusManagerWillDisappear:]`.

Here is an example on how to hide and show the status bar. As the delegate methods are called inside an animation block, the status bar will be hidden or shown with animation.
```objc
- (void)mediaFocusManagerWillAppear:(ASMediaFocusManager *)mediaFocusManager
{
    self.statusBarHidden = YES;
	[self setNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdate];
}

- (void)mediaFocusManagerWillDisappear:(ASMediaFocusManager *)mediaFocusManager
{
    self.statusBarHidden = NO;
    [self setNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdate];
}

- (BOOL)prefersStatusBarHidden
{
    return self.statusBarHidden;
}

// statusBarHidden is defined as a property.
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL statusBarHidden;

```


## Todo
* Allow the use of your own video control view.
* Fix image jump on orientation change when fullscreen image is zoomed (only when parent ViewController supports UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait | UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortraitUpsideDown)
* Media browsing by horizontal swipe in fullscreen.
* Close focus view by vertical swipe like in facebook app (partly done thanks to @harishkashyap, Feb 09, 2015).
* ~~Add a play icon on video thumbnail.~~ (April 2, 2015)
* ~~Improve the elastic (ie natural) effect on focus and defocus rotation.~~ (April 1, 2015)
* ~~Support movie media.~~ (April 1, 2015)
* ~~Hide accessory views (button and label) when view is zoomed.~~ (March 5, 2014)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Akkyie/AKPickerView.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Akkyie/AKPickerView)

A simple yet customizable horizontal picker view.

Works on iOS 6, 7 and 8.

*__News__: Say Good-Bye to Bridging-Header! 
The Swift version is [here](https://github.com/Akkyie/AKPickerView-Swift).*

Installation
------------

Use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)

    pod ""AKPickerView""

…or simply add AKPickerView.h/m into your project.

Usage
-----

*__Caveat__*: From version 2.0, `dataSource` separated from `delegate`. When you updated it, check new how to use below.

1. Instantiate and set `delegate` and `dataSource` as you know,
	```objc
	self.pickerView = [[AKPickerView alloc] initWithFrame:<#frame#>];
	self.pickerView.delegate = self;
	self.pickerView.dataSource = self;
	```
	
1. then specify the number of items using `AKPickerViewDataSource` methods,
	```objc
	- (NSUInteger)numberOfItemsInPickerView:(AKPickerView *)pickerView;
	```
1. and specify contents to be shown. You can use either texts or images:
	```objc
	- (NSString *)pickerView:(AKPickerView *)pickerView titleForItem:(NSInteger)item;
	// OR
	- (UIImage *)pickerView:(AKPickerView *)pickerView imageForItem:(NSInteger)item;
	```
    - Using both texts and images are currently not supported. When you implement both, `-pickerView:titleForItem` will be called and the other won't. 
    - You currently cannot specify image sizes; AKPickerView shows the original image in its original size. Resize your images in advance if you need.

1. You can change its appearance with properties below.
	```objc
	@property (nonatomic, strong) UIFont *font;
	@property (nonatomic, strong) UIFont *highlightedFont;
	@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *textColor;
	@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *highlightedTextColor;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat interitemSpacing;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat fisheyeFactor;
	```
    - All cells are laid out depending on the largest font, so large differnce between the sizes of *font* and *highlightedFont* is NOT recommended.  
    - fisheyeFactor property affects perspective distortion. The range is 0.0 - 1.0; slight value such as 0.0001 is recommended.

1. After all settings, **never forget to reload your picker**.
	```objc
	[self.pickerView reloadData];
	```
1. Optional: You can use `AKPickerViewDelegate` method to observe selection changes:
	
	```objc
	- (void)pickerView:(AKPickerView *)pickerView didSelectItem:(NSInteger)item;
	```
	Additionally, you can use `UIScrollViewDelegate` method to observe scrolling.
    
For more detail, see the sample project.

NewAmsterdamLabs/ZOZolaZoomTransition,Objective-C,"# ZOZolaZoomTransition

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NewAmsterdamLabs/ZOZolaZoomTransition.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NewAmsterdamLabs/ZOZolaZoomTransition)
[![CocoaPods Version](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/ZOZolaZoomTransition.svg)](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/ZOZolaZoomTransition)

`ZOZolaZoomTransition` is a zoom transition that animates the entire view heirarchy. It is used extensively in the [Zola iOS application](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zola-wedding-registry-gifts/id852691916?mt=8).

It looks like this:




## Example

`ZOZolaZoomTransition` ships with a fully functional demo project. Listed below are the basic implementation steps. Assume a typical ""Master-Detail"" scenario where the ""master"" controller contains a `UICollectionView`, and the ""detail"" controller is pushed onto the stack when a cell is tapped. The transition will be animated from the selected cell's `imageView`, to the detailController's `imageView`: 

1. Implement this `UINavigationControllerDelegate` method and return an instance of `ZOZolaZoomTransition`:

  ```objective-c
  - (id )navigationController:(UINavigationController *)navigationController     
                                     animationControllerForOperation:(UINavigationControllerOperation)operation 
                                                  fromViewController:(UIViewController *)fromVC 
                                                    toViewController:(UIViewController *)toVC {
      
      // Determine if we're presenting or dismissing
      ZOTransitionType type = (fromVC == self) ? ZOTransitionTypePresenting : ZOTransitionTypeDismissing;
      
      // Create a transition instance with the selected cell's imageView as the target view
      ZOZolaZoomTransition *zoomTransition = [ZOZolaZoomTransition transitionFromView:_selectedCell.imageView
                                                                                 type:type
                                                                             duration:0.5
                                                                             delegate:self];
      
      return zoomTransition;
  }
  ```

2. Implement the two required `ZOZolaZoomTransitionDelegate` methods to provide the starting and finishing frames for the target view (see [ZOZolaZolaZoomTransition.h](ZOZolaZoomTransition/ZOZolaZoomTransition.h) for detailed documentation). Frames must be returned relative to the provided `relativeView`:

  ```objective-c
  - (CGRect)zolaZoomTransition:(ZOZolaZoomTransition *)zoomTransition
          startingFrameForView:(UIView *)targetView

## Supplementary Views

`ZOZolaZoomTransition` supports an optional array of supplementary views that will be drawn on top of, and animated with, the other views in the animation. Two common use cases for  supplementary views are:
 
 1. To draw views that are on top of, but not a child of, the target view.
 2. To draw views that are clipped by the edge of the screen when the transition begins
    and therefore appear cut off during the animation.

This is best illustrated with an example. The row of cells below is clipped by the bottom of the screen when the user taps the left most cell. Here are two screenshots mid-transition:

**Without supplementary views:**





**With supplementary views:** 
(the ""Group Gift"" banner and the two cells to the right have been added as supplementary views and are therefore drawn on top of the animation)





## App Extensions

`ZOZolaZoomTransition` makes use of `UIApplication`'s `beginIgnoringInteractionEvents` and `endIgnoringInteractionEvents` methods which are not available inside of app extensions. To use `ZOZolaZoomTransition` in an extension, define the following preprocessor macro in the extension target's build settings: 
`ZO_APP_EXTENSIONS=1`





## Setup Instructions

Install with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) by adding the following to your Podfile:

``` ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod 'ZOZolaZoomTransition', '~> 1.0.1'
```

Or do it manually by adding `ZOZolaZoomTransition.h` & `ZOZolaZoomTransition.m` to your project.

## Limitations

- `ZOZolaZoomTransition` currently only works with `UINavigationController` transitions. We still need to add support for modal transitions, ideally without changing the API. Pull requests welcome!
- No support for interactive transitions yet (although this should be pretty straightforward to implement)

## Requirements

`ZOZolaZoomTransition` requires iOS 7.0 or higher.

## License

`ZOZolaZoomTransition` is available under the MIT license. See the `LICENSE` file for more info.

# grunt-wiredep
*Inject Bower packages into your source code with Grunt.*
>
> -

## What is this?
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) is great.

[Bower](http://bower.io) is great.

**And now they work great together.**

`grunt-wiredep` is a Grunt plug-in, which finds your components and injects them directly into the HTML file you specify.

Whether you're already using Bower and Grunt, or new to both, `grunt-wiredep` will be easy to plug in, as you will see in the steps below.

_**do note**: Bower is still a young little birdy, so things are changing rapidly. Authors of Bower components must follow certain conventions and best practices in order for this plug-in to be as accurate as possible. It's not a perfect world out there, so needless to say, some Bower components may not work as well as others._

## Getting Started

*If you are new to Grunt, you will find a lot of answers to your questions in their [getting started guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

To install the module:
```
npm install --save-dev grunt-wiredep
```

Include the task in your Gruntfile:
```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-wiredep');
```

Create a config block within your Gruntfile:
```js
wiredep: {

  task: {

    // Point to the files that should be updated when
    // you run `grunt wiredep`
    src: [
      'app/views/**/*.html',   // .html support...
      'app/views/**/*.jade',   // .jade support...
      'app/styles/main.scss',  // .scss & .sass support...
      'app/config.yml'         // and .yml & .yaml support out of the box!
    ],
    
    options: {
      // See wiredep's configuration documentation for the options
      // you may pass:

      // https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep#configuration
    }
  }
}
```

See [wiredep's readme](http://github.com/taptapship/wiredep#configuration) for more options of customization, such as other file types, regex patterns, exclusions, and more.

Options can be specified on both task and target level. See [grunt documentation](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#options) for more details on how this works.

For  dependencies, pop this in your HTML file:
```html


```

Install a Bower component:
```
bower install jquery --save
```

Call the Grunt task:
```
grunt wiredep
```

You're in business!
```html



```

## Behind the Scenes
This plug-in uses [wiredep](https://github.com/stephenplusplus/wiredep), which takes a look at all of the components you have, then determines the best order to inject your scripts in to your HTML file.

Putting script tags that aren't managed by `grunt-wiredep` is not advised, as anything between `` and `` will be overwritten with each command.

## Examples
A simple sample apple:

googlearchive/big-rig,CSS,"# Big Rig

Big Rig is an **experimental**, **proof-of-concept** system for generating and parsing Chrome's trace files. It has a web app dashboard that will allow you to track performance statistics over time, as well as a CLI version for integrating with other parts of your build system.

![Big Rig web app](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/617438/10881331/b83e9868-8159-11e5-9f0e-285549e89c76.png)

Both the web app and CLI ingest trace files that can come from:

* [WebPagetest](http://webpagetest.org)
* [Chrome DevTools’ Timeline](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/profile/evaluate-performance/timeline-tool)
* [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)
* [Telemetry](https://www.chromium.org/developers/telemetry)

In this project there are two sub-items:

1. [A dashboard web app](app/).
1. [An automated Chrome test runner](test-runner/).

There is also a CLI / node module for Big Rig, which [you can find in its own repo](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/node-big-rig).

## Issues

There are many missing features, tests, and options that need adding to Big Rig. However, in the interests of launch early and iterate often (a grand tradition), the repo is here for all to see! Do feel free to file issues against it, though.

## Roadmap

Mainly at this point it's to deprecate the python-based backend for the web app and replace it with the JS- /NodeJS-based one. This will provide some additional options on processing traces for one, and should allow for a more of a plugin-based solution.

Glow-Inc/GLCalendarView,Objective-C,"![GLCalendarView](https://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/v/GLCalendarView/badge.png)

## Demo

![GLCalendarView](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Glow-Inc/GLCalendarView/master/demo.gif)

## Installation
#### CocoaPods
With CocoaPods you can simply add `GLCalendarView` in your Podfile:
```
pod ""GLCalendarView"", ""~> 1.0.0""
```
#### Source File
You can copy all the files under the `Sources` folder into your project.

## Usage
* Init the view by placing it in the storyboard or programmatically init it and add it to your view controller.
* In `viewDidLoad`, set the `firstDate` and `lastDate` of the calendarView.
* In `viewWillAppear`, set up the model data and call `[self.calendarView reload];` to refresh the calendarView.

To display some ranges in the calendar view, construct some `GLCalendarDateRange` objects, set them as the model of the calendar view
```objective-c
NSDate *today = [NSDate date];
NSDate *beginDate = [GLDateUtils dateByAddingDays:-23 toDate:today];
NSDate *endDate = [GLDateUtils dateByAddingDays:-18 toDate:today];
GLCalendarDateRange *range = [GLCalendarDateRange rangeWithBeginDate:beginDate endDate:endDate];
range.backgroundColor = COLOR_BLUE;
range.editable = YES;
range.binding = yourModelObject // you can bind your model to the range

self.calendarView.ranges = [@[range1] mutableCopy];
[self.calendarView reload];
```

For the binding field, it helps in that you can bind the actual model to the range, thus you can easily retrieve the corresponding model from the range later. For example, if you are building a trip app, you probably has a Trip class, you can bind the Trip instance to the range, and if the range gets updated in the calendar view, you can easily get the Trip instance from it and do some further updates.

The calendar view will handle all the user interactions including adding, updating, or deleting a range, you just need to implement the delegate protocol to listen for those events:
```objective-c
@protocol GLCalendarViewDelegate 
- (BOOL)calenderView:(GLCalendarView *)calendarView canAddRangeWithBeginDate:(NSDate *)beginDate;
- (GLCalendarDateRange *)calenderView:(GLCalendarView *)calendarView rangeToAddWithBeginDate:(NSDate *)beginDate;
- (void)calenderView:(GLCalendarView *)calendarView beginToEditRange:(GLCalendarDateRange *)range;
- (void)calenderView:(GLCalendarView *)calendarView finishEditRange:(GLCalendarDateRange *)range continueEditing:(BOOL)continueEditing;
- (BOOL)calenderView:(GLCalendarView *)calendarView canUpdateRange:(GLCalendarDateRange *)range toBeginDate:(NSDate *)beginDate endDate:(NSDate *)endDate;
- (void)calenderView:(GLCalendarView *)calendarView didUpdateRange:(GLCalendarDateRange *)range toBeginDate:(NSDate *)beginDate endDate:(NSDate *)endDate;
@end
```

Sample implementation:
```objective-c
- (BOOL)calenderView:(GLCalendarView *)calendarView canAddRangeWithBeginDate:(NSDate *)beginDate
{
    // you should check whether user can add a range with the given begin date
    return YES;
}

- (GLCalendarDateRange *)calenderView:(GLCalendarView *)calendarView rangeToAddWithBeginDate:(NSDate *)beginDate
{
    // construct a new range object and return it
    NSDate* endDate = [GLDateUtils dateByAddingDays:2 toDate:beginDate];
    GLCalendarDateRange *range = [GLCalendarDateRange rangeWithBeginDate:beginDate endDate:endDate];
    range.backgroundColor = [UIColor redColor];
    range.editable = YES;
    range.binding = yourModel // bind your model to the range instance
    return range;
}

- (void)calenderView:(GLCalendarView *)calendarView beginToEditRange:(GLCalendarDateRange *)range
{
    // save the range to a instance variable so that you can make some operation on it
    self.rangeUnderEdit = range;
}

- (void)calenderView:(GLCalendarView *)calendarView finishEditRange:(GLCalendarDateRange *)range continueEditing:(BOOL)continueEditing
{
    // retrieve the model from the range, do some updates to your model
    id yourModel = range.binding;
    self.rangeUnderEdit = nil;
}

- (BOOL)calenderView:(GLCalendarView *)calendarView canUpdateRange:(GLCalendarDateRange *)range toBeginDate:(NSDate *)beginDate endDate:(NSDate *)endDate
{
    // you should check whether the beginDate or the endDate is valid
    return YES;
}

- (void)calenderView:(GLCalendarView *)calendarView didUpdateRange:(GLCalendarDateRange *)range toBeginDate:(NSDate *)beginDate endDate:(NSDate *)endDate
{
    // update your model if necessary
    id yourModel = range.binding;
}

```

## Appearance
`GLCalendarView` 's appearance is fully customizable, you can adjust its look through the appearance api(generally your should config it in the AppDelegate), check the header file to see all customizable fields:
```objective-c
[GLCalendarView appearance].rowHeight = 54;
[GLCalendarView appearance].padding = 6;
[GLCalendarView appearance].weekDayTitleAttributes = @{NSFontAttributeName:[UIFont systemFontOfSize:8], NSForegroundColorAttributeName:[UIColor grayColor]};
[GLCalendarView appearance].monthCoverAttributes = @{NSFontAttributeName:[UIFont systemFontOfSize:30]};

[GLCalendarDayCell appearance].dayLabelAttributes = @{NSFontAttributeName:[UIFont systemFontOfSize:20], NSForegroundColorAttributeName:UIColorFromRGB(0x555555)};
[GLCalendarDayCell appearance].monthLabelAttributes = @{NSFontAttributeName:[UIFont systemFontOfSize:8]};
    
[GLCalendarDayCell appearance].editCoverBorderWidth = 2;
[GLCalendarDayCell appearance].editCoverBorderColor = UIColorFromRGB(0x366aac);
[GLCalendarDayCell appearance].editCoverPointSize = 14;

[GLCalendarDayCell appearance].todayBackgroundColor = UIColorFromRGB(0x366aac);
[GLCalendarDayCell appearance].todayLabelAttributes = @{NSFontAttributeName:[UIFont systemFontOfSize:20]};

[GLCalendarDayCell appearance].rangeDisplayMode = RANGE_DISPLAY_MODE_CONTINUOUS;
```

nxtbgthng/OAuth2Client,Objective-C,"# OAuth2Client

An OAuth2 library for Mac OS X & iOS (Cocoa & Cocoa touch).

## Description

This library is based on [draft 10 of the OAuth2 spec](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-10).
It implements the [native application profile](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-10#section-1.4.3)
and supports the end-user authorization endpoint via an internal or an external user-agent. Furthermore it
also supports the user credentials flow by prompting the end-user for their username and password and use them
directly to obtain an access token. See the description of the delegate for more information how to choose the
authentication flow.

## Getting started

### Get the sources

Getting the sources is as easy as doing a:  
`git clone git://github.com/nxtbgthng/OAuth2Client.git`

### Adding the library to your project using CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Xcode projects. It manages the above
installation steps automatically.

In order to install the library this way add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```pod 'NXOAuth2Client', '~> 1.2.8'```

and run the following command `pod install`.

*Note:* CocoaPods is now the preferred way to integrate NXOAuth2Client into Xcode

### Manually including the library in your Xcode project

#### iOS projects

* Place the _OAuth2Client_ folder within your source root
* Drag the _OAuth2Client.xcodeproj_ into your project
* Under your build target, select the _Build Phases_ tab.
    * Under _Target Dependencies_ add _OAuth2Client_
    * Under _Link Binary With Libraries_, add _libOAuth2Client.a_
* Under _Build Settings_,
    * Add `$(SRCROOT)/path/to/OAuth2Client` _Header Search Paths_, set as _recursive_
    * Add `-ObjC` to _Other Linker Flags_
* `#import ""NXOAuth2.h""`
* add the Security.framework as a build dependency

#### Desktop Mac projects

- drag the OAuth2Client.xcodeproj into your project
- add OAuth2Client.framework as a build dependency
- add the Security.framework as a build dependency
- add `$(CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR)/$(CONTENTS_FOLDER_PATH)/Frameworks` to your targets Framework Search Path
- link your target against OAuth2Client (drag the OAuth2Client.framework product from OAuth2Client.xcodeproj
to your targets *Link Binary With Libraries*)
- `#import `

*Using the library as a framework in desktop applications is fairly untested. Please
[report any issues](http://github.com/nxtbgthng/OAuth2Client/issues) and help in making the library better.*



## Using the OAuth2Client

### Configure your Client

The best place to configure your client is `+[UIApplicationDelegate initialize]` on iOS or `+[NSApplicationDelegate initialize]` on Mac OS X. There you can call `-[NXOAuth2AccountStore setClientID:secret:authorizationURL:tokenURL:redirectURL:forAccountType:]` on the shared account store for each service you want to have access to from your application. The account type is a string which is used as an identifier for a certain service.


+ (void)initialize;
{
	[[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] setClientID:@""xXxXxXxXxXxX""
                                             secret:@""xXxXxXxXxXxX""
                                   authorizationURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@""https://...your auth URL...""]
                                           tokenURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@""https://...your token URL...""]
                                        redirectURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@""https://...your redirect URL...""]
                                     forAccountType:@""myFancyService""];
}


Take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/nxtbgthng/OAuth2Client/wiki) for some examples.

Unless otherwise specficied, the token request will be called with a HTTP Header 'Content-Type' set to 'multipart/form-data'.  If you wish that header to be set to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', the custom header fields must be modified.


NSMutableDictionary *configuration = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithDictionary:[[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] configurationForAccountType:kOAuth2AccountType]];
NSDictionary *customHeaderFields = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"" forKey:@""Content-Type""];
[configuration setObject:customHeaderFields forKey:kNXOAuth2AccountStoreConfigurationCustomHeaderFields];
[[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] setConfiguration:configuration forAccountType:kOAuth2AccountType];

  
Consult the documentation of the OAuth2 provider to determine acceptable Content-Type header values. 

    

### Requesting Access to a Service

Once you have configured your client you are ready to request access to one of those services. The NXOAuth2AccountStore provides three different methods for this:

- Username and Password
 
 [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] requestAccessToAccountWithType:@""myFancyService""
 	                                                       username:aUserName
 	                                                       password:aPassword];
 

- External Browser
 
 [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] requestAccessToAccountWithType:@""myFancyService""];
 
  
 If you are using an external browser, your application needs to handle the URL you have registered as an redirect URL for the account type (e.g. a custom URL scheme like `myfancyscheme://oauth`). The service will redirect to that URL after the authentication process.
 
 In `-[AppDelegate application: openURL: sourceApplication: annotation:]` pass the redirect URL to
 
     [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] handleRedirectURL: url];
 

- Provide an Authorization URL Handler
 
 [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] requestAccessToAccountWithType:@""myFancyService""
 	                            withPreparedAuthorizationURLHandler:^(NSURL *preparedURL){
 	                                // Open a web view or similar
 	                            }];
 
 Using an authorization URL handler gives you the ability to open the URL in an own web view or do some fancy stuff for authentication. Therefore you pass a block to the NXOAuth2AccountStore while requesting access.
 
 One method for receiving a code and exchanging it for an auth token requires the following:
 
  1) Load the preparedURL into an existing UIWebView as part of the block code above. Be certain to set the delegate for the UIWebView.
  
 
 [_webView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:preparedURL]];
 
 
  2) In the `webViewDidFinishLoad:` delegate method, you will need to parse the URL for your callback URL.  If there is a match, pass that URL to `-[NXOAuth2AccountStore handleRedirectURL:]`

 
 if ([webView.request.URL.absoluteString rangeOfString:kOAuth2RedirectURL options:NSCaseInsensitiveSearch].location != NSNotFound) {
        [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] handleRedirectURL:[NSURL URLWithString:webView.request.URL.absoluteString]];        
    }
   

This is a very basic example.  In the above, it is assumed that the `code` being returned from the OAuth2 provider is in the query parameter of the webView.request.URL (i.e. `http://myredirecturl.com?code=`).  This is not always the case and you may have to look elsewhere for the code (e.g. in the page content, web page title).  You must prepare a URL in the format described above to pass to `-[NXOAuth2AccountStore handleRedirectURL:]`.

#### On Success

After a successful authentication, a new `NXOAuth2Account` object is in the list of accounts of `NXOAuth2AccountStore`. You will receive a notification of type `NXOAuth2AccountStoreAccountsDidChangeNotification`, e.g., for updating your UI.

[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName:NXOAuth2AccountStoreAccountsDidChangeNotification
                                                  object:[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore]
                                                   queue:nil
                                              usingBlock:^(NSNotification *aNotification){
                                                    // Update your UI
                                              }];

If an account was added the `userInfo` dictionary of the notification will contain the new account at the `NXOAuth2AccountStoreNewAccountUserInfoKey`. Note though that this notification can be triggered on other events (e.g. account removal). In that case this key will not be set.

#### On Failure

If the authentication did not succeed, a notification of type `NXOAuth2AccountStoreDidFailToRequestAccessNotification` containing an `NSError` will be sent.

[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName:NXOAuth2AccountStoreDidFailToRequestAccessNotification
                                                  object:[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore]
                                                   queue:nil
                                              usingBlock:^(NSNotification *aNotification){
                                                    NSError *error = [aNotification.userInfo objectForKey:NXOAuth2AccountStoreErrorKey];
                                                    // Do something with the error
                                              }];


### Getting a List of all Accounts

The authenticated accounts can be accessed via the `NXOAuth2AccountStore`. Either the complete list, only a list of accounts for a specific service or an account with an identifier (maybe cached in the user settings).


for (NXOAuth2Account *account in [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] accounts]) {
    // Do something with the account
};

for (NXOAuth2Account *account in [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] accountsWithAccountType:@""myFancyService""]) {
    // Do something with the account
};

NXOAuth2Account *account = [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] accountWithIdentifier:@""...cached account id...""];


Each `NXOAuth2Account` has a property `userData` which can be used to store some related information for that account.

NXOAuth2Account *account = // ... get an account
NSDictionary *userData = // ...

account.userData = userData;


This payload will be stored together with the accounts in the Keychain. Thus it shouldn't be too big.

### Removing Accounts

To remove an account and its tokens from the store:


[[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore]  removeAccount:account];


Note that if you used a UIWebView to request access to a service as described above, it's likely that the token has been cached in `[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage]`

You can remove the auth token from the cookie cache using:


for(NSHTTPCookie *cookie in [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] cookies]) {
    if([[cookie domain] isEqualToString:@""myapp.com""]) {
        [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] deleteCookie:cookie];
    }
}
[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] synchronize];


Where `myapp.com` is the domain from which you received the auth token -- likley the `authorizationURL` assigned to the store at the time of request.  As a convenience, you may want to store the domain of the token in the `account.userData` so that it is readily available if you need to delete the cookies.

### Invoking a Request

A request using the authentication for a service can be invoked via `NXOAuth2Request`. The most convenient method (see below) is a class method which you pass the method, a resource and some parameters (or nil) for the request and to handlers (both optional). One for a progress and the other for the response. The account is used for authentication and can be nil. Then a normal request without authentication will be invoked.

[NXOAuth2Request performMethod:@""GET""
                    onResource:[NSURL URLWithString:@""https://...your service URL...""]
               usingParameters:nil
                   withAccount:anAccount
           sendProgressHandler:^(unsigned long long bytesSend, unsigned long long bytesTotal) { // e.g., update a progress indicator }
               responseHandler:^(NSURLResponse *response, NSData *responseData, NSError *error){
                   // Process the response
               }];


#### Getting a signed NSURLRequest

In some circumstances you have to go the *good old way* and use an `NSURLConnection`. Maybe if you want to download a large file. Therefore `NXOAuth2Request` gives you the possibility to get an `NSURLRequest` containing the additional information to authenticate that request.


NXOAuth2Request *theRequest = [[NXOAuth2Request alloc] initWithResource:[NSURL URLWithString:@""https://...your service URL...""]
									                             method:@""GET""
								                             parameters:nil];
theRequest.account = // ... an account
                               
NSURLRequest *sigendRequest = [theRequest signedURLRequest];

[theRequest release];

// Invoke the request with you preferd method


#### Fully Parametrized File Upload


// Get fileSize
NSDictionary *fileAttributes = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] attributesOfItemAtPath:uploadFile.localDataFilePath error:nil];
NSNumber *fileSize = [fileAttributes valueForKey:NSFileSize];

drduan/minggeJS,JavaScript,"# MingGeJS1.9.4.2016完美正式版
>HEAD

 English version is [here](README_en.md).
 
 
 
 
 
 PS 1.95版本
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 1：继续加强 创建节点  接口，新增多类型数据传入 。
 

  2：新增 prepend appendTo prependTo before after ，完全和JQ一一模一样，，而且带事件克隆效果，这些接口分别做了大量的工作，createNode接口，继续存在，保留参数传入


  3：先前取 单个对象 需要  $(""div"").nodeList[0],一直惹起各方用户反感，纷纷说“JQ都不是这样的，作者技术不够吧”，因此我又做了大量工作，现在可以$(""div"")[0] 可以这样取了


 4：选择器接口深度修复，细节不详，以及执行效率增强，可以告诉大家，比JQ最小快2倍，逻辑不比JQ少，ZEPTO更甩开他几条街。


  5：新增克隆节点 ， $(""div"").clone(参数) 参数为TRUE时，连事件一起克隆，包括子节点。参数非TRUE时，只克隆节点，包括子节点，这个接口和JQ一模一样的，具体看JQ的方档；


   6：新增add  map 接口，具体请看JQ方档，反正一模一样的；


   7： filter 新增可以传入FUNCTION 示例  $(""div"").filter(function(){ return this.nodeType==1;  })，和JQ一模一样的；


   8：新增依赖加载接口（非标准型）,$.createScript；


   9：新增可以这样创节点 $(""123"")，还有  $([1,2,3,4]) 这样传入   还有  $( document.getElementsByTagName(""div"")) 节点列表传入，DOM传入等，非常人性化；


   10：新增 MingGe.noConflict() 方法让渡变量 $ 的 MingGe 控制权。

该方法释放  MingGe 对 $ 变量的控制。

 该方法也可用于为  MingGe 变量规定新的自定义名称.

对的，这个接口和JQ一样的，麻烦大家移步看JQ方档这个接口的详解


 11：以及N多API进行深度调整


  可以说1.95是MingGeJs一个思想更开放，更放纵的版本，能完全用“全面改革开放”来形容这次的更新，所有API，做到密不透风，非常严格！
  目的就是，用户开心，我就开心，没有用户我就不开心。 MinggeJS经历过好几次的重大的更新，我一直好努力，好努力，我失去好多私人时间，
  对于MingGeJS我越踩越深了！我无法自拨了。
  我的好想在国内范围能取代JQ的位置，MinggeJS真的可以做到比JQ优秀，求大家给个机会我，给个机会MingGeJS
  我希望大家可以试用一下，用来应付大型项目完全能驾驭。我知道网络上很多对minggeJS的负面评论，你要记住，只是1.6第一个版本的事
 ,是我完成一个星期就发布的版本，无可否认，用垃圾来形容是对的，但是1.95已经走向成熟。1.6之前的代码已经基本消失。 
  MingGeJS已经做了大量单元测试，绝不可能有严重BUG，最后说一声：“给个机会MingGeJS,给个机会作者，真的想取代JQ的位置”



---


>PS:MingGeJS 1.9.3.完美正式版 升级

1：新增取兄弟节点API接口 $(XXX).siblings(),$(XXX).prev(),$(XXX).prevAll(),$(XXX).next(),$(XXX).nextAll()。我不介绍了，和JQUERY的接口一样的。

2：新增content 取文本节点， 不介绍了和JQUERY一样的。

3：修复选择器为 为“*”号时，取不出节点，例如$(""*"").filter(""*""),已深度修复。

4：修复children取出来的子节点有误。

5: 修正特殊情况下$(xxx)指向被错误劫持的问题！

6: 以及部份API细节作了深度调整。

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


         结语：minggeJS并不单单山寨JQUERY，更多的是融入我自己思想。minggeJS的CSS3动画做得不错的，比ZEPTO动画要好是肯定的，
　　　　　　　　例如串联动画，zepto是没有的，所以minggeJS非常合适合来做手机端，做各种复杂的ＣＳＳ３动画，
                另外minggeJS支持模块及插件形式分离开发，大致用法基本和JQUERY一致，有部份函数用法则有所稍略
                请大家看DEMO.html演试！（DEMO.html已大幅度更新）

                我是mingge,请支持国产MingGeJs



------------
继优秀作品shearphoto截图插件，本人又再推出国产山寨JQUERY，为什么我要开发一个山寨JQUERY？老实说我从来没用过JQUERY，正因为我反感JQUERY。

继优秀作品shearphoto截图插件，本人又再推出国产山寨jQuery，为什么我要开发一个山寨jQuery？老实说我从来没用过jQuery，正因为我反感jQuery。

我给了他一个霸气的名字：MingGeJs，  

MingGeJs是什么？它是我一个星期完成的作品，它是一个JS类库，它拥有和jQuery相同的语法，相同函数，相同的函数用法， 但是动画，选择器性能，函数
效率都在JQ之上，同时兼容IE 6 7 8，同时与jQuery相兼容

它的名字叫MingGeJs，MingGe就是我的大名， 一看到插件名字，就知道作者是我，知道它是国产的，让别人知道国产类库一样做得很出色，出众

本人文化程度不高，初中毕业！半句英文都不会，但是我相信只要肯努力一样可以实现自己的梦想。MingGeJS的梦想有点大胆，就是在全球范围内，占据

jQuery百分之50以上的用户份额。MingGeJs已在GIT开源，欢迎各路前端高手对MingGeJs类库进行评测！  

我是mingge    请支持国产minggeJS类库，因为我们都是中国人。    

下面我介绍一下minggeJS几大优点。

minggeJS具有以下优点
1：选择器执行速度胜出jQuery，
   以十万个DIV节点测试，分别用minggeJS与jQuery选择器取出指定节点测试：
 jQuery结果 ：     IE7以上：花时1800毫秒   IE7 花时   8135毫秒     IE6   花时超过30-40秒之间，浏览器随机卡死。
 minggeJS结果：    IE7以上：花时1500毫秒   IE7花时    5132毫秒      IE6花时 23-35秒之间   浏览器也有卡死现象，但次数少。
  花时越少，选择器性能越强，从结果来看，minggeJS大获全胜。    司徒正美也开发了一个号称世界最快的选择器，我也测试了下，从结果来看和我不分上下的！
  还有一点值得提提，居闻jQuery的选择器不是自己公司原创的，是用第三方选择器改出来的！minggeJS的选择器问心无愧地说全部是我原创开发的   
2：众所周之，JQUERY的动画原理是采用定时器方原理，minggeJS原理不同，minggeJS的动画采用的是CSS3过渡原理，遗憾的是minggeJS的动画不支持IE678。 minggeJS并不是第一个采用CSS3过渡动画，zepto的动画也是采用这个原理，可惜zepto动画做得真心差，zepto是不支持串联式动画的，用zepto做复杂动画，简直是一大败笔。   minggeJS则支持动画串联，支持高效准确回调，支持接口查询是否正在动画等，可以告诉大家用minggeJS做手机动画，绝对是最佳的选择！      
3：语法，函数用法，函数名称，都与JQUERY一致，只要会JQUERY，你就会更用minggeJS,易学易用，马上上手。部份函数用法稍有不同，例如mingge新建节点是用$(XX).createNode(),比JQUERY方便很多！
  minggeJS不单单是山寨JQUERY，更多的是融入了自己的思想，想法！
4：文件体积20K左右，后期升级可能会维持在40K左右，我自己的想法就是希望不超过40K。
5： minggeJS后期的发展，更多是想往手机端发展，即使战不胜JQUERY，能战胜zepto也是赏心悦目的事。再者就是动画方面，打算采用两种模式供用户选择，1种是CSS3，第2种CSS2定时器方式，定时器方式，估计以插件方式发布！

ScienJus/spring-restful-authorization,Java,"###简介

关于Demo的介绍可以参考[RESTful登录设计（基于Spring及Redis的Token鉴权）][1]

###演示方式

 1. 下载该项目并修改application.properties文件，将MySQL和Redis的信息修改为自己的配置
 2. 打开init.sql文件，将其中的sql语句在MySQL中运行
 3. 通过mvn spring-boot:run启动项目，如果日志输出Started Application in 8.112 seconds (JVM running for 14.491)说明启动成功
 4. 浏览器打开localhost:8080，可以看到swagger-ui的主页
 5. 演示登录：在该页面打开POST tokens/，在username项输入admin、password项输入password，点击Try it out！，查看返回结果得到userId和token
 6. 演示退出登录：在该页面打开DELETE tokens/，在authorization中填写用userId和token以""_""拼接得到的字符串，点击Try it out！，如果返回码为200则成功。重复一次操作，返回码将变为401

###可能会遇到的问题：

**java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.jboss.jandex.IndexView**

原因是缺少`org.jboss:jandex:1.1.0Final`依赖，可能需要您手动在`pom.xml`中依赖中添加以下内容：

```

org.jboss
jandex
1.1.0.Final

```

感谢@yrain的反馈！

###其他

如果这个Demo的功能刚好可以满足你的需求，在这里推荐我根据其封装的库：[Spring Authorization Manager][2]，希望能帮助你完成API服务端的身份验证功能。

twotoasters/TWTSideMenuViewController,Objective-C,"## TWTSideMenuViewController

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twotoasters/TWTSideMenuViewController.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twotoasters/TWTSideMenuViewController)

One of the most common implementations of menu views has been the ""Side Drawer"", ""basement"", or ""Side Menu"" made popular in apps such as Facebook and Path. When the user taps to open the side menu the user's main context slides to the right (or left in some implementations) to display another view _below_. This works well in iOS 6 and before. What does it mean for iOS 7?

With iOS 7, apps are encouraged to use the whole screen and not rely on the 20pt status bar to be outside of the plane of your app. This breaks the existing side bar idea in that the status bar now lives over two view contexts with a single style.

![Bad Side Bar](Artifacts/side-bar-bad.png)

Working with the team at Luvocracy, we needed to find a way to show a side menu for our iOS 7 release. Many designers on [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com) began [looking at a new approach](http://dribbble.com/shots/1154748-WhatsApp-iOS-7-Redesign) for [side bars](http://dribbble.com/shots/1185823-Side-menu). Inspired by this we worked up a quick prototype that slides the view to the right and scales revealing the menu as seen in the dribbble samples above. Moving forward from this idea and inspired by other ideas from iOS 7 we changed it from a slide to more of a viewport change.

![SideMenuViewController](Artifacts/TWTSideMenu.gif)

### Usage

TWTSideMenuViewController is implemented using a single parent view controller that manages your menu and main views as child view controllers. To set it up, initialize a new instance of TWTSideMenuViewController and supply a menu view controller and a main view controller.

```objective-c

  // application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:

  self.menuViewController = [[UIViewController alloc] initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil];
  self.mainViewController = [[UIViewController alloc] initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil];
  
  // create a new side menu
  self.sideMenuViewController = [[TWTSideMenuViewController alloc] initWithMenuViewController:self.menuViewController mainViewController:[[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:self.mainViewController]];

  // specify the shadow color to use behind the main view controller when it is scaled down.
  self.sideMenuViewController.shadowColor = [UIColor blackColor];

  // specify a UIOffset to offset the open position of the menu
  self.sideMenuViewController.edgeOffset = UIOffsetMake(18.0f, 0.0f);

  // specify a scale to zoom the interface — the scale is 0.0 (scaled to 0% of it's size) to 1.0 (not scaled at all). The example here specifies that it zooms so that the main view is 56.34% of it's size in open mode. 
  self.sideMenuViewController.zoomScale = 0.5634f;

  // set the side menu controller as the root view controller
  self.window.rootViewController = self.sideMenuViewController;

```

Later, when you need to change what is in the main view controller's context you can simply set the view controller with the convenience method:

```objective-c

  // All views presented in a side menu view controller have access to the side menu directly. Much like the way UINavigationController works. To swap to a new view controller simply set the main view controller:

  [self.sideMenuViewController setMainViewController:controller animated:YES closeMenu:YES];

```

### TODO

- Find additional requirements as the library is used in additional apps. (This initial version was built to meet the needs of a single app).
- Add Tests

### Requirements

- Base SDK: iOS 7
- Deployment Target: iOS 6+

Pixate/pixate-freestyle-ios,Objective-C,"# Pixate Freestyle

Pixate Freestyle is a native iOS (and [Android](https://github.com/pixate/pixate-freestyle-android)) library that styles native controls with CSS. With Freestyle, you can replace many complicated lines of  with a few lines of CSS. This simplifies and centralizes your styling code, and [offers other benefits](http://www.freestyle.org/) as well.

> **Note: Pixate Freestyle iOS is no longer being directly supported. You may want to consider [StylingKit](https://github.com/StylingKit/StylingKit) which is a maintained (as of 2017-08) fork of Pixate Freestyle. Pixate Freestyle has problems with naming conflicts with some Apple classes on iOS 10 and 11.**

## Getting Started

### Installation

There are several ways to download and install the Pixate Freestyle framework.

The easiest is to [download the installer](http://www.freestyle.org/downloads/freestyle/PixateFreestyle-2.1.4.pkg), which always contains the latest  version, and drag **PixateFreestyle.framework** into your Xcode project. Alternatively, you can download the framework file only (i.e. no samples) by going to the [releases section](https://github.com/Pixate/pixate-freestyle-ios/releases) of this repo.

*NOTE: The installer will place the files into your **Documents** folder in a folder named **PixateFreestyle***. 

 Once installed, add the following import to the top of your **main.m** file:

```
#import 
```

In the body of your main method, add the following line before the return:

```
[PixateFreestyle initializePixateFreestyle];
```

Your main method should look something like this:

```
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    @autoreleasepool {
        [PixateFreestyle initializePixateFreestyle];
        return UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, NSStringFromClass([AppDelegate class]));
    }
}
```

If you use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), install the Freestyle cocoapod by adding **PixateFreestyle** to your Podfile:

```
pod 'PixateFreestyle'
```

### RubyMotion, Xamarin, and Titanium

Modules are also available (with source code) for using Pixate Freestyle on iOS with:

* [RubyMotion](https://github.com/Pixate/RubyMotion-PixateFreestyle)
* [Xamarin](https://github.com/Pixate/Xamarin-PixateFreestyle)
* [Titanium](https://github.com/Pixate/Titanium-PixateFreestyle)

### Migrating from Pixate Framework

If you are migrating from the Pixate Framework, you’ll only need to make a few changes, namely updating your imports to use ‘PixateFreestyle’ and updating your initialization method in your main.m.

In terms of your ‘#import” lines, just update them to read as follows:

```
#import 
```

And like the Installation step above, just change your main.m to look like the following, you no longer need to use a license key or user name.

```
#import 

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    @autoreleasepool {
        [PixateFreestyle initializePixateFreestyle];
        return UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, NSStringFromClass([AppDelegate class]));
    }
}
```

### Styling Apps with CSS

Pixate Freestyle allows you to add IDs, Class'es, and inline styles to your native components, and style them with CSS. Learn more about this [here](http://pixate.github.io/pixate-freestyle-ios/style-reference/index.html#app_structure).

For now, let’s make a simple app that styles a single button. Follow [this short video](http://player.vimeo.com/video/79832578) and then add the following CSS code to a new file, `default.css`, in your Xcode project.

    ```
    view {
      background-color: #ffffff
    }

    .btn-green {
      color            : #446620;
      background-color : linear-gradient(#87c44a, #b4da77);
      border-width     : 1px;
      border-color     : #84a254;
      border-style     : solid;
      border-radius    : 10px;
      font-size        : 13px;
    }
    ```

### Moving Faster with Themes

You can build the style of your app piece-by-piece using the method above. For even faster development, use a pre-built [Freestyle theme](http://pixate.github.io/pixate-freestyle-ios/themes). Themes have pre-built CSS and Sass that can be quickly customized to style an entire app. Learn more [here](http://pixate.github.io/pixate-freestyle-ios/themes).

## Mailing List & Twitter

Keep up with notifications and announcements by joining Pixate's [mailing list](http://pixatesurvey.herokuapp.com) and [follow us](http://twitter.com/PixateFreestyle) on Twitter.

## Docs

You can find the latest Pixate Freestyle documentation [here](http://pixate.github.io/pixate-freestyle-ios).

## Compiling Freestyle Source

To compile the Pixate Freestyle source outside of Xcode or your project, just clone the repo and go into the **scripts/** directory. From there, run the '**build_framework.sh**' script. It will compile the framework and create a ""FAT"" binary and place it in a **build/** folder at the root level of the repo.

rails/exception_notification,Ruby,"= Exception Notifier Plugin for Rails

The Exception Notifier plugin provides a mailer object and a default set of
templates for sending email notifications when errors occur in a Rails
application. The plugin is configurable, allowing programmers to specify:

* the sender address of the email
* the recipient addresses
* the text used to prefix the subject line

The email includes information about the current request, session, and
environment, and also gives a backtrace of the exception.

== Usage

As of Rails 3 ExceptionNotifier is used as a rack middleware

  Whatever::Application.config.middleware.use ExceptionNotifier,
    :email_prefix => ""[Whatever] "",
    :sender_address => %{""notifier"" },
    :exception_recipients => %w{exceptions@example.com}

== Customization

By default, the notification email includes four parts: request, session,
environment, and backtrace (in that order). You can customize how each of those
sections are rendered by placing a partial named for that part in your
app/views/exception_notifier directory (e.g., _session.rhtml). Each partial has
access to the following variables:

* @controller: the controller that caused the error
* @request: the current request object
* @exception: the exception that was raised
* @backtrace: a sanitized version of the exception's backtrace
* @data: a hash of optional data values that were passed to the notifier
* @sections: the array of sections to include in the email

You can reorder the sections, or exclude sections completely, by altering the
ExceptionNotifier.sections variable. You can even add new sections that
describe application-specific data--just add the section's name to the list
(whereever you'd like), and define the corresponding partial. Then, if your
new section requires information that isn't available by default, make sure
it is made available to the email using the exception_data macro:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    before_filter :log_additional_data
    ...
    protected
      def log_additional_data
        request.env[""exception_notifier.exception_data""] = {
          :document => @document,
          :person => @person
        }
      end
    ...
  end

In the above case, @document and @person would be made available to the email
renderer, allowing your new section(s) to access and display them. See the
existing sections defined by the plugin for examples of how to write your own.

== Notification

After an exception notification has been delivered the rack environment variable
'exception_notifier.delivered' will be set to +true+.

== Rails 2.3 stable and earlier

If you are running Rails 2.3 then see the branch for that: 
 
  http://github.com/rails/exception_notification/tree/2-3-stable

If you are running pre-rack Rails then see this tag: 

  http://github.com/rails/exception_notification/tree/pre-2-3

=============
[![CocoaPods](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/BFPaperButton.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/bfeher/BFPaperButton)

> A flat button inspired by Google Material Design's Paper theme.

![Animated Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bfeher/BFPaperButton/master/BFPaperButtonDemoGif2.gif ""Animated Screenshot"")


About
---------
### Now with smoother animations and more public properties for even easier customization!

_BFPaperButton_ is a subclass of UIButton that behaves much like the new paper buttons from Google's Material Design Labs.
All animation are asynchronous and are performed on sublayers.
BFPaperButtons work right away with pleasing default behaviors, however they can be easily customized! The corner radius, tap-circle color, background fade color, and tap-circle diameter are all readily customizable via public properties.

BFPaperButtons come in 2 flavors, Flat or Raised. 
Flat BFPaperButtons have no shadow and will remain flat through all animations. Flat buttons can be transparent, in which case the background will also fade a little when tapped.
Raised BFPaperButtons have a drop shadow that animates along with a tap, giving it the feeling of raising up with your touch. Raised BFPaperButtons do not look good with a clear background color since it will expose their shadow layer underneath.

By default, BFPaperButtons use ""Smart Color"" which will match the tap-circle and background fade colors to the color of the `titleLabel`.
You can turn off Smart Color by setting the property, `.usesSmartColor` to `NO`. If you disable Smart Color, a gray color will be used by default for both the tap-circle and the background color fade.
You can set your own colors via: `.tapCircleColor` and `.backgroundFadeColor`. Note that setting these disables Smart Color.

***Note*** *that setting the button type to Custom in the Storyboard is required to prevent the title from fading out on UIControlStateHighlighted.*

## Properties

`UIColor *shadowColor`
> The UIColor for the shadow of a raised button. An alpha value of `1` is recommended as shadowOpacity overwrites the alpha of this color.

`CGFloat loweredShadowOpacity`
> A CGFLoat representing the opacity of the shadow of RAISED buttons when they are lowered (idle). Default is `0.5f`.

`CGFloat loweredShadowRadius`

> A CGFLoat representing the radius of the shadow of RAISED buttons when they are lowered (idle). Default is `1.5f`.

`CGSize loweredShadowOffset`

> A CGSize representing the offset of the shadow of RAISED buttons when they are lowered (idle). Default is `(0, 1)`.

`CGFloat liftedShadowOpacity`

> A CGFLoat representing the opacity of the shadow of RAISED buttons when they are lifted (on touch down). Default is `0.5f`.

`CGFloat liftedShadowRadius`

> A CGFLoat representing the radius of the shadow of RAISED buttons when they are lifted (on touch down). Default is `4.5f`.

`CGSize liftedShadowOffset`

> A CGSize representing the offset of the shadow of RAISED buttons when they are lifted (on touch down). Default is `(2, 4)`.

`CGFloat touchDownAnimationDuration`

> A CGFLoat representing the duration of the animations which take place on touch DOWN! Default is `0.25f` seconds. (Go Steelers)

`CGFloat touchUpAnimationDuration`

> A CGFLoat representing the duration of the animations which take place on touch UP! Default is `2 * touchDownAnimationDuration` seconds.

`CGFloat tapCircleDiameterStartValue`

> A CGFLoat representing the diameter of the tap-circle as soon as it spawns, before it grows. Default is `5.f`.

`CGFloat tapCircleDiameter`

> The CGFloat value representing the Diameter of the tap-circle. By default it will be the result of `MAX(self.frame.width, self.frame.height)`. `tapCircleDiameterFull` will calculate a circle that always fills the entire view. Any value less than or equal to `tapCircleDiameterFull` will result in default being used. The constants: `tapCircleDiameterLarge`, `tapCircleDiameterMedium`, and `tapCircleDiameterSmall` are also available for use. */

`CGFloat tapCircleBurstAmount`

> The CGFloat value representing how much we should increase the diameter of the tap-circle by when we burst it. Default is `100.f`.

`CGFloat cornerRadius`

> The corner radius which propagates through to the sub layers. Default is `0`.

`UIColor *tapCircleColor`

> The UIColor to use for the circle which appears where you tap. NOTE: Setting this defeats the ""Smart Color"" ability of the tap circle. Alpha values less than `1` are recommended.

`UIColor *backgroundFadeColor`
> The UIColor to fade clear backgrounds to. NOTE: Setting this defeats the ""Smart Color"" ability of the background fade. Alpha values less than `1` are recommended.

`BOOL rippleFromTapLocation`
> A flag to set to `YES` to have the tap-circle ripple from point of touch. If this is set to `NO`, the tap-circle will always ripple from the center of the view. Default is `YES`.

`BOOL rippleBeyondBounds`
> A flag to set to `YES` to have the tap-circle ripple beyond the bounds of the view. If this is set to `NO`, the tap-circle will be clipped to the view's bounds. Default is `NO`.

`BOOL isRaised`
> A flag to set to `YES` to CHANGE a flat view to raised, or set to `NO` to CHANGE a raised view to flat. If you used one of the provided custom initializers, you should probably leave this parameter alone. If you instantiated via storyboard or IB and want to CHANGE from riased to flat, this is the parameter for you! Default is `YES`.

`BOOL usesSmartColor`
> A flag to set YES to use Smart Color, or NO to use a custom color scheme. While Smart Color is the default (usesSmartColor = YES), customization is cool too.


### Notes on RAISED vs FLAT and SMART COLOR vs NON SMART COLOR:
##### RAISED
Has a shadow, so a clear background will look silly. It has only a tap-circle color. No background-fade.

##### FLAT
Has no shadow, therefore clear backgrounds look fine. If the background is clear, it also has a background-fade color to help visualize the button and its frame.

##### SMART COLOR
Will use the titleLabel's font color to pick a tap circle color and, if the background is clear, will also pick a lighter background fade color.

##### NON SMART COLOR
Will use a translucent gray tap-circle and, if the background is clear, a lighter translucent gray background-fade color.


Usage
---------
Add the _BFPaperButton_ header and implementation file to your project. (.h & .m)

### Creating a Flat BFPaperButton
```objective-c
BFPaperButton *flatPaperButton = [[BFPaperButton alloc] initWithFrame:rect raised:NO];
```

### Creating a Raised BFPaperButton
```objective-c
BFPaperButton *raisedPaperButton = [[BFPaperButton alloc] initWithFrame:rect raised:YES];
```

### Working Example
*(Taken directly from example project.)*
```objective-c
BFPaperButton *bfFlatSmart = [[BFPaperButton alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(20, 20, 280, 43) raised:NO];
[bfFlatSmart setTitle:@""BFPaperButton Flat: Smart Color"" forState:UIControlStateNormal];
bfFlatSmart.backgroundColor = [UIColor paperColorGray600];	// You can find this from my other library, BFPaperColors :)
[bfFlatSmart setTitleColor:[UIColor whiteColor] forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[bfFlatSmart setTitleColor:[UIColor whiteColor] forState:UIControlStateHighlighted];
[bfFlatSmart addTarget:self action:@selector(buttonWasPressed:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
[self.view addSubview:bfFlatSmart];
```

### Customized Example
*(Taken directly from example project.)*
```objective-c
BFPaperButton *circle2 = [[BFPaperButton alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(116, 468, 86, 86) raised:YES];
[circle2 setTitle:@""Custom"" forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[circle2 setTitleColor:[UIColor whiteColor] forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[circle2 setTitleColor:[UIColor whiteColor] forState:UIControlStateHighlighted];
[circle2 addTarget:self action:@selector(buttonWasPressed:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
circle2.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.3 green:0 blue:1 alpha:1];
circle2.tapCircleColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:1 green:0 blue:1 alpha:0.6];  // Setting this color overrides ""Smart Color"".
circle2.cornerRadius = circle2.frame.size.width / 2;
circle2.rippleFromTapLocation = NO;
circle2.rippleBeyondBounds = YES;
circle2.tapCircleDiameter = MAX(circle2.frame.size.width, circle2.frame.size.height) * 1.3;
[self.view addSubview:circle2];
```

michaelhenry/FlipBoardNavigationController,Objective-C,"FlipBoardNavigationController
=============================

This is a new navigation controller inspired by Flipboard.


# Usage

## Creating your controller
Somewhere, for example in your app delegate, alloc and init the controller :

    _flipboardNavigationController = [[FlipBoardNavigationController alloc]initWithRootViewController:rootViewController];

Then, add it to the window

	self.window.rootViewController = _flipboardNavigationController;

or to a view 

	[self.view addSubview:_flipboardNavigationController.view];
	

You can add a navigation controller on top, for example : 

	MainViewController *main = [[MainViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""MainViewController"" bundle:nil];
    _flipboardNavigationController = [[FlipBoardNavigationController alloc]initWithRootViewController:rootViewController];
    self.window.rootViewController = _flipboardNavigationController;
    
## Pushing a controller
You have several options to push a controller
The easiest way is : 

	[self.flipboardNavigationController pushViewController:anotherViewController];

or you can also use the completion block if ever you need it.

	[self.flipboardNavigationController pushViewController:anotherViewController completion:^{
        NSLog(@""Complete"");
    }];


## Popping
To go back to your parent view controller, you can pop :

	 [self.flipboardNavigationController popViewController];

or 

	[self.flipboardNavigationController popViewControllerWithCompletion:^{
        <#code#>
    }].

rob-brown/RBStoryboardLink,Objective-C,"# RBStoryboardLink

# DEPRECATED

With Apple's recent release of iOS 9 and Xcode 7, linking storyboards has become a natively-supported workflow. I don't know, but I certainly hope the community's large interest in `RBStoryboardLink` played a role in this change to Interface Builder. I appreciate all the ideas and contributions that have come from the community. `RBStoryboardLink` started its life simply as a proof-of-concept, and it became far more popular than imagined. 

Since I work almost exclusively with the latest version of iOS, it's becoming harder for me to maintain `RBStoryboardLink`. This repository will remain available for anyone who needs to work with iOS 8 and earlier. There are also many forks available (120 at the time of this writing). It's sad to deprecate my most popular GitHub project, but it's wonderful that it's replaced by an officially-supported option. Thank you again for all the community support. 

## Summary

`RBStoryboardLink` started out as a proof-of-concept and that is still largely the case. It may not work in all cases. Furthermore, `RBStoryboardLink` should not be used without first understanding storyboards.

`UIStoryboards` are very powerful and useful. However, to make the best use of storyboards, they need to be broken down into natural modules. The problem with having many storyboards is writing the code to transition between them. `RBStoryboardLink` solves this problem by allowing ""pseudo-segues"" between `UIStoryboards`. These segues can be built without leaving Interface Builder and without writing any extra code.

## Dependencies

`RBStoryboardLink` requires iOS 7.0+. With some modifications it can support iOS 6 as well, but I wanted to keep it simple. `RBStoryboardLink` cannot simultaneously support iOS 5 and 7 due to the large functionality differences.

## How to use

**NOTE:** As of 0.1.0, there is a new workflow. The old workflow only used `RBStoryboardLink`. It was responsible for all the work by acting as a proxy for the real view controller. In the new workflow, `RBStoryboardLink` merely provides information for `RBStoryboardSegue`. `RBStoryboardSegue` redirects the segue on presentation. This redirection avoids the complexity of `UIViewController` containment and dereferencing a proxy in methods such as `-prepareForSegue:sender:`. The new workflow is thanks to [@MBulli][3].

1. Your app's storyboards must first be decomposed into their natural modules. See this [guide][1] for some tips.

2. Where ever you want create a transition into a different storyboard, create a `UIViewController` representing the scene to be pushed.

3. Create the desired segue type (Push, Modal, Custom) to these surrogate view controllers. To take advantage of the new linking, set the type to custom and choose one of `RBStoryboardPushSegue`, `RBStoryboardModalSegue`, or `RBStoryboardPopoverSegue`. You may also create subclasses of `RBStoryboardSegue` for custom transitions.

4. In the Identity Inspector, change the class type of each surrogate view controller to `RBStoryboardLink`.

5. While still in the Identity Inspector, add one or more User Defined Runtime Attributes.

    1. storyboardName (Required) The name of the storyboard to transition into.
    2. sceneIdentifier (Optional) The identifier of the view controller to transition to. If left blank, this will push the first view controller.
    3. needsTopLayoutGuide (Optional) Whether a custom layout constraint should be added to the top layout guide in storyboards. If you notice the background of your navigation bar not getting behind the status bar, set this to `NO`. This property is unused if using one of the `RBStoryboardSegue`s.
    4. needsBottomLayoutGuide (Optional) Same as the one on top, but for the bottom guide. This property is unused if using one of the `RBStoryboardSegue`s.

## Implementation notes

* When using a `UITabBarController` with `UINavcontroller`s in the tabs. Place the `UINavigationController`s in the same storyboard as the `UITabBarController`.

## Demos

There are two demos that are provided to show how to use `RBStoryboardLink`:

* A standard, straightforward workflow.

* A tabbed workflow.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcomed. I'm much more responsive to pull requests rather than issues. The sample apps use [KIF][2] for automated testing. Any pull requests must pass the tests before they will be merged. If new functionality is introduced, the pull requests must also add tests for the new behavior. If you want to contribute and don't know what to tackle, take a look at the issues list.

58code/Argo,Java,"## 历史，动机(motivation)

Argo起源与[58同城]的内部web框架wf(web framework)。

目前wf支撑着[58同城]几乎所有的web站点，包括wap和手机端的访问等，现在wf每天处理10亿级的请求。经过长时间的运作与运行，证明wf是一个可靠的、高效的web框架。


作为一个有一定规模的互联网企业，如果在变化的互联网环境中上线一个项目，在软件开发中需要在三方面进行平衡：

1. 组织/公司，在一个组织内部，需要每个项目开发尽量有统一的风格、架构，学习成本、维护成本等尽可能低；
1. 运维，希望每个站点的配置和可执行部分分离，部署的方式相同；
1. 项目内部，希望程序员聚焦在业务上，可以快速实现产品需求、响应产品变化。
在此基础上，我们开发了wf。

Argo在wf做了大量优化和重构，以适应各组织软件开发的个性化需求，提升了系统性能，具有更好的可扩展性。Argo的开源反过来也促进wf2.0的开发。


## 哲学观 (philosophy)
1. [约定优于配置]，减少软件开发人员需做决定的数量，获得简单的好处，而又不失灵活性。Argo体系中有且只有一个组织级约定，规定包的命名，配置文件路径，日志文件路径等。组织的约定是不容侵犯，每个项目在组织级约定下工作。组织级约定建议以jar形式下发给各项目。
1. 简单，Argo可以不需要任何配置文件，项目代码结构简单，易于维护。
1. 纪律，包和类的命名都受组织级约定的控制，任何违反约定的行为可能导致系统无法正常运行。

## 系统特点 (features)

1. SEO友好的URL结构，Argo天然支持RESTful的url结构，并能自动匹配合适的参数；
1. 零配置，甚至你不要web.xml就能在tomcat上运行；
1. 插拔式组件架构，可以灵活扩张功能；
1. 高安全性，提供集群模式下，避免ip欺骗等功能。

## 系统约定 (convention)

Argo不是一个通用的web框架，一个问题解决方案可能有很多，但在Argo中只提供一种解决方案。Argo在以下约定中工作：

1. servlet 3.0环境，主要针对Tomcat 7.x；
1. 基于[guice]的Ioc，组织和项目可以各提供一个module注入模块，而且module的命名必须符合约定；
1. maven依赖，项目的代码体系和maven默认代码体系一致，maven以插件提供开发过程中所需要的开发运行环境（[jetty:run]或[tomcat7:run]）。

## Hello World

请参考例子 samples/hello-world

```shell
mvn tomcat7:run
```

或者
```shell
mvn jetty:run
```

然后浏览

http://localhost/

## 进阶

TODO

## 如何实现 (how)

TODO

## 更新日志
### 2013-03-21
1. 修正 issues #1, #2,
1. 修正 ContextPath不是根目录(""/"")下无法正常运行的bug
1. 提供model中默认参数 __beat,便于在view中使用
1. 提供war:war打包plugin实例，移除web.xml的依赖

```xml


org.apache.maven.plugins
maven-war-plugin
2.3

false

dchester/epilogue,JavaScript,"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dchester/epilogue.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dchester/epilogue) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/dchester/epilogue.svg)](https://david-dm.org/dchester/epilogue)

# Epilogue

Create flexible REST endpoints and controllers from [Sequelize](http://www.sequelizejs.com/) models in your [Express](http://expressjs.com/) or [Restify](https://github.com/restify/node-restify) app.

### Getting Started
```javascript
var Sequelize = require('sequelize'),
    epilogue = require('epilogue'),
    http = require('http');

// Define your models
var database = new Sequelize('database', 'root', 'password');
var User = database.define('User', {
  username: Sequelize.STRING,
  birthday: Sequelize.DATE
});

// Initialize server
var server, app;
if (process.env.USE_RESTIFY) {
  var restify = require('restify');

  app = server = restify.createServer()
  app.use(restify.queryParser());
  app.use(restify.bodyParser());
} else {
  var express = require('express'),
      bodyParser = require('body-parser');

  var app = express();
  app.use(bodyParser.json());
  app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
  server = http.createServer(app);
}

// Initialize epilogue
epilogue.initialize({
  app: app,
  sequelize: database
});

// Create REST resource
var userResource = epilogue.resource({
  model: User,
  endpoints: ['/users', '/users/:id']
});

// Create database and listen
database
  .sync({ force: true })
  .then(function() {
    server.listen(function() {
      var host = server.address().address,
          port = server.address().port;

      console.log('listening at http://%s:%s', host, port);
    });
  });
```

### Controllers and endpoints

On the server we now have the following controllers and endpoints:

Controller | Endpoint | Description
-----------|----------|------------
userResource.create | POST /users | Create a user
userResource.list | GET /users  | Get a listing of users
userResource.read | GET /users/:id | Get details about a user
userResource.update | PUT /users/:id | Update a user
userResource.delete | DELETE /users/:id | Delete a user

### Customize behavior

Of course it's likely that we'll want more flexibility.
Our `users` resource has properties for each of the controller actions.
Controller actions in turn have hooks for setting and overriding behavior at each step of the request.
We have these milestones to work with: `start`, `auth`, `fetch`, `data`, `write`, `send`, and `complete`.

```javascript
var ForbiddenError = require('epilogue').Errors.ForbiddenError;

// disallow deletes on users
userResource.delete.auth(function(req, res, context) {
    throw new ForbiddenError(""can't delete a user"");
    // optionally:
    // return context.error(403, ""can't delete a user"");
})
```

We can set behavior for milestones directly as above, or we can add functionality before and after milestones too:

```javascript
// check the cache first
userResource.list.fetch.before(function(req, res, context) {
	var instance = cache.get(context.criteria);

	if (instance) {
		// keep a reference to the instance and skip the fetch
		context.instance = instance;
		return context.skip;
	} else {
		// cache miss; we continue on
		return context.continue;
	}
})
```

Milestones can also be defined in a declarative fashion, and used as middleware with any resource. For example:

```javascript
// my-middleware.js
module.exports = {
  create: {
    fetch: function(req, res, context) {
      // manipulate the fetch call
      return context.continue;
    }
  },
  list: {
    write: {
      before: function(req, res, context) {
        // modify data before writing list data
        return context.continue;
      },
      action: function(req, res, context) {
        // change behavior of actually writing the data
        return context.continue;
      },
      after: function(req, res, context) {
        // set some sort of flag after writing list data
        return context.continue;
      }
    }
  }
};

// my-app.js
var epilogue = require('epilogue'),
    restMiddleware = require('my-middleware');

epilogue.initialize({
    app: app,
    sequelize: sequelize
});

var userResource = epilogue.resource({
    model: User,
    endpoints: ['/users', '/users/:id']
});

userResource.use(restMiddleware);
```

Epilogue middleware also supports bundling in extra resource configuration by specifying
an ""extraConfiguration"" member of the middleware like so:

```javascript
// my-middleware.js
module.exports = {
  extraConfiguration: function(resource) {
    // support delete for plural form of a resource
    var app = resource.app;
    app.del(resource.endpoints.plural, function(req, res) {
      resource.controllers.delete._control(req, res);
    });
  }
};
```

To show an error and halt execution of milestone functions you can throw an error:

```javascript
var ForbiddenError = require('epilogue').Errors.ForbiddenError;

before: function(req, res, context) {
    return authenticate.then(function(authed) {
        if(!authed) throw new ForbiddenError();

        return context.continue;
    });
}
```

## REST API

Listing resources support filtering, searching, sorting, and pagination as described below.

### Filtering

Add query parameters named after fields to limit results.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost/users?name=James+Conrad

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    ""name"": ""James Conrad"",
    ""email"": ""jamesconrad@fastmail.fm""
  }
]
```

### Filtering using scope

Use `scope` to add additional filtering (More about scopes in sequelize - [http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/docs/scopes/](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/docs/scopes/)).

```bash
  // Define scope in model
  ...
  scope: {
    verified: {
      where : {
        email_verified: true
        phone_verified: true
      }  
    }
  }
```

```bash
$ curl http://localhost/users?scope=verified

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    ""name"": ""James Conrad"",
    ""email"": ""jamesconrad@fastmail.fm""
    ""email_verified"": true,
    ""phone_verified"": true
  }
]
```

### Search

Use the `q` parameter to perform a substring search across all fields.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost/users?q=james

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    ""name"": ""James Conrad"",
    ""email"": ""jamesconrad@fastmail.fm""
  }, {
    ""name"": ""Jim Huntington"",
    ""email"": ""jamesh@huntington.mx""
  }
]
```

Search behavior can be customized to change the parameter used for searching, as well as which attributes are included in the search, like so:

```javascript
var userResource = epilogue.resource({
    model: User,
    endpoints: ['/users', '/users/:id'],
    search: {
      param: 'searchOnlyUsernames',
      attributes: [ 'username' ]
    }
});
```

This would restrict substring searches to the ```username``` attribute of the User model, and the search parameter would be 'searchOnlyUsernames':

```bash
$ curl http://localhost/users?searchOnlyUsernames=james
```

By default, the substring search is performed using a ```{field} LIKE '%{query}%'``` pattern. However, this behavior can be customized by specifying a search operator. Valid operators include: `$like` (default), `$ilike`/`$iLike`, `$notLike`, `$notILike`, `$ne`, `$eq`, `$not`, `$gte`, `$gt`, `$lte`, `$lt`. All ""\*like"" operators can only be used against Sequelize.STRING or Sequelize.TEXT fields. For instance:

```javascript
var userResource = epilogue.resource({
    model: User,
    endpoints: ['/users', '/users/:id'],
    search: {
      operator: '$gt',
      attributes: [ 'age' ]
    }
});
```

When querying against a Sequelize.BOOLEAN field, you'll need to use the `$eq` operator. You can also add multiple search parameters by passing the search key an array of objects:

```javascript
var userResource = epilogue.resource({
    model: User,
    endpoints: ['/users', '/users/:id'],
    search: [
      {operator: '$eq', param: 'emailVerified', attributes: [ 'email_verified' ]},
      {param: 'searchOnlyUsernames', attributes: [ 'username' ]}
    ] 
});
```

### Sorting

Specify the `sort` parameter to sort results.  Values are field names, optionally preceded by a `-` to indicate descending order.  Multiple sort values may be separated by `,`.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost/users?sort=-name

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    ""name"": ""Jim Huntington"",
    ""email"": ""jamesh@huntington.mx""
  }, {
    ""name"": ""James Conrad"",
    ""email"": ""jamesconrad@fastmail.fm""
  }
]
```

Sort behavior can be customized to change the parameter used for sorting, as well as which attributes are allowed to be used for sorting like so:

```javascript
var userResource = epilogue.resource({
    model: User,
    endpoints: ['/users', '/users/:id'],
    sort: {
      param: 'orderby',
      attributes: [ 'username' ]
    }
});
```

This would restrict sorting to only the ```username``` attribute of the User model, and the sort parameter would be 'orderby':

```bash
$ curl http://localhost/users?orderby=username
```

Default sort criteria can be defined with the `default` attribute. The expected format for default sort criteria is exactly the same as if it was proceeding the `sort` parameter in the URL.

```javascript
var userResource = epilogue.resource({
    model: User,
    endpoints: ['/users', '/users/:id'],
    sort: {
      default: '-email,username'
    }
});
```
With this configuration, these two calls would result in the same data:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost/users
$ curl http://localhost/users?sort=-email,username
```

Note that the `sort` parameter in the URL will override your default criteria.

By default all attributes defined on the model are allowed to be sorted on. Sorting on a attribute not allowed will cause a 400 error to be returned with errors in the format:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost/users?sortby=invalid,-otherinvalid,valid

HTTP/1.1 400 BAD REQUEST
Content-Type: application/json

{
  ""message"": ""Sorting not allowed on given attributes"",
  ""errors"": [""invalid"", ""otherinvalid""]
}
```

### Pagination

List routes support pagination via `offset` or `page` and `count` query parameters.  Find metadata about pagination and number of results in the `Content-Range` response header. Pagination defaults to a default of 100 results per page, and a maximum of 1000 results per page.

```bash
# get the third page of results
$ curl http://localhost/users?offset=200&count=100

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Range: items 200-299/3230

[
  { ""name"": ""James Conrad"", ... },
  ...
]
```

Alternatively, you can specify that pagination is disabled for a given resource by passing false to the pagination property like so:

```javascript
var userResource = epilogue.resource({
    model: User,
    endpoints: ['/users', '/users/:id'],
    pagination: false
});
```

## Epilogue API

#### initialize()

Set defaults and give epilouge a reference to your express app.  Send the following parameters:

> ###### app
>
> A reference to the Express application
>
> ###### base
>
> Prefix to prepend to resource endpoints
>
> ###### updateMethod
>
> HTTP method to use for update routes, one of `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH`

#### resource()

Create a resource and CRUD actions given a Sequelize model and endpoints.  Accepts these parameters:

> ###### model
>
> Reference to a Sequelize model
>
> ###### endpoints
>
> Specify endpoints as an array with two sinatra-style URL paths in plural and singular form (e.g., `['/users', '/users/:id']`).
>
> ###### actions
>
> Create only the specified list of actions for the resource.  Options include `create`, `list`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`.  Defaults to all.
>
> ###### excludeAttributes
>
> Explicitly remove the specified list of attributes from read and list operations
>

### Milestones & Context

Check out the [Milestone docs](/docs/Milestones.md) for information on lifecycle
hooks that can be used with epilogue resources, and how to run custom code at
various points during a request.

## Protecting Epilogue REST Endpoints

To protect an endpoint, you must use [milestones](/docs/Milestones.md).

In order to protect and endpoint (for example, to require that only a logged in user
or user with the appropriate security token can access a resource) you need to use
the appropriate milestone hooks.

Below is an example of how to do this with standard Express middleware, which is
commonly used to protect resources.  Note that the callback functions required by
Epilogue milestones look similar to express middleware, but the third argument (`context`)
is different.

Suppose you have this resource:

```javascript
var userResource = rest.resource({
    model: User
});
```

To protect all endpoints, we'll use `userResource.all.auth`, a hook used to authorize the
endpoint before any operation (`create`, `list`, etc).  Suppose also we have an
express middlware function called `authorize(req, res, done)`.   This authorize
function might for example be a passport strategy such as `passport('local')`.

To authorize the endpoint, you would do this:

```javascript
userResource.all.auth(function (req, res, context) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    authorize(req, res, function (arg) {
      if (arg) {
        // Middleware function returned an error; this means the operation
        // should not be authorized.
        res.status(401).send({message: ""Unauthorized""});
        resolve(context.stop);
      } else {
        resolve(context.continue);
      }
  });
})
```

In this code, note that `userResource.all.auth` is simply reusing the express middleware
to do whatever authorization checking your code requires.  We are passing a custom
`done` function to the middleware, which resolves a promise as either `context.stop`
or `context.continue`, indicating to epilogue whether or not to proceed.  Note that
in the case where the transaction isn't authorized, epilogue won't proceed, so it
is your responsibility to send a response back to the client.

### Further Information on Protecting Endpoints

The milestone documentation provides many other hooks for finer-grained operations,
i.e. permitting all users to `list` but only some users to `delete` can be implemented
by using the same approach described above, with different milestones.

iOS 7 Calendar with Infinite Scrolling. Only need 4 lines of code to set up.

> [RSDayFlow](https://github.com/ruslanskorb/RSDayFlow) is a slim fork of [DayFlow](https://github.com/evadne/DayFlow) with updates and extensions:

* Visual feedback of the currently selected cell
* Possibility to mark the date
* Design like iOS 7
* Much more updates

## Installation

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended method of installing RSDayFlow. Simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

#### Podfile

```ruby
pod 'RSDayFlow'
```

## Basic Usage

Import the class header.

``` objective-c
#import ""RSDFDatePickerView.h""
```

Just create your date picker view and set a delegate / a data source if needed.

``` objective-c
- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    
    RSDFDatePickerView *datePickerView = [[RSDFDatePickerView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];
    datePickerView.delegate = self;
    datePickerView.dataSource = self;
    [self.view addSubview:datePickerView];
}
```

## Delegate (optional)

`RSDFDatePickerView` provides three delegate methods. The method `datePickerView:shouldHighlightDate:` asks the delegate if the date should be highlighted during tracking. The method `datePickerView:shouldSelectDate:` asks the delegate if the specified date should be selected. The method `datePickerView:didSelectDate:` called when a user click on a specific date. To use them, implement the delegate in your view controller.

```objective-c
@interface ViewController () 
```

Then implement the delegate functions.

```objective-c
// Returns YES if the date should be highlighted or NO if it should not.
- (BOOL)datePickerView:(RSDFDatePickerView *)view shouldHighlightDate:(NSDate *)date
{
    return YES;
}

// Returns YES if the date should be selected or NO if it should not.
- (BOOL)datePickerView:(RSDFDatePickerView *)view shouldSelectDate:(NSDate *)date
{
    return YES;
}

// Prints out the selected date.
- (void)datePickerView:(RSDFDatePickerView *)view didSelectDate:(NSDate *)date
{
    NSLog(@""%@"", [date description]);
}
```

## DataSource (optional)

`RSDFDatePickerView` provides three data source methods. The method `datePickerView:shouldMarkDate:` asks the data source if the date should be marked. The method `datePickerView:markImageColorForDate:` asks the data source about the color of the default mark image for the specified date. The method `datePickerView:markImageForDate:` asks the data source about the mark image for the specified date. The method `datePickerView:markImageColorForDate:` will be ignored if the method `datePickerView:markImageForDate:` is implemented. To use these methods, implement the data source in your view controller.

```objective-c
@interface ViewController () 
```

Then implement the data source functions.

```objective-c
// Returns YES if the date should be marked or NO if it should not.
- (BOOL)datePickerView:(RSDFDatePickerView *)view shouldMarkDate:(NSDate *)date
{
    // The date is an `NSDate` object without time components.
    // So, we need to use dates without time components.
    
    NSCalendar *calendar = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];
    unsigned unitFlags = NSYearCalendarUnit | NSMonthCalendarUnit |  NSDayCalendarUnit;
    NSDateComponents *todayComponents = [calendar components:unitFlags fromDate:[NSDate date]];
    NSDate *today = [calendar dateFromComponents:todayComponents];
    
    return [date isEqual:today];
}

// Returns the color of the default mark image for the specified date.
- (UIColor *)datePickerView:(RSDFDatePickerView *)view markImageColorForDate:(NSDate *)date
{
    if (arc4random() % 2 == 0) {
        return [UIColor grayColor];
    } else {
        return [UIColor greenColor];
    }
}

// Returns the mark image for the specified date.
- (UIImage *)datePickerView:(RSDFDatePickerView *)view markImageForDate:(NSDate *)date
{
    if (arc4random() % 2 == 0) {
        return [UIImage imageNamed:@""img_gray_mark""];
    } else {
        return [UIImage imageNamed:@""img_green_mark""];
    }
}
```

## Customization

Every view is customizable to fit your need.
Create a subclass of the desired view and override the default values.

## Coming Soon

- If you would like to request a new feature, feel free to raise as an issue.

## Demo

Build and run the `RSDayFlowExample` project in Xcode to see `RSDayFlow` in action.
Have fun. Make it faster. Fork and send pull requests. Figure out hooks for customization.

krakjoe/phpdbg,C,"The interactive PHP debugger
============================

Implemented as a SAPI module, phpdbg can exert complete control over the environment without impacting the functionality or performance of your code.

phpdbg aims to be a lightweight, powerful, easy to use debugging platform for PHP 5.4+

[![phpdbg on travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/krakjoe/phpdbg.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/krakjoe/phpdbg)

Historical Repository
=====================

phpdbg was developed here, then merged into [php-src](https://github.com/php/php-src): This repository is no longer used.

__Please open issues on [bugsnet](http://bugs.php.net), and send pull requests directly to [php-src](https://github.com/php/php-src).__

Features
========

 - Stepthrough Debugging
 - Flexible Breakpoints (lass Method, Function, File:Line, Address, Opcode)
 - Easy Access to PHP with built-in eval()
 - Easy Access to urrently Executing ode
 - Userland API
 - SAPI Agnostic - Easily Integrated
 - PHP onfiguration File Support
 - JIT Super Globals - Set Your Own!!
 - Optional readline Support - omfortable Terminal Operation
 - Remote Debugging Support - Bundled Java GUI
 - Easy Operation - See Help :)

Planned
=======

 - Improve Everything :)

Installation
============

To install **phpdbg**, you must compile the source against your PHP installation sources, and enable the SAPI with the configure command.

```
cd /usr/src/php-src/sapi
git clone https://github.com/krakjoe/phpdbg
cd ../
./buildconf --force
./configure --enable-phpdbg
make -j8
make install-phpdbg
```

Where the source directory has been used previously to build PHP, there exists a file named *config.nice* which can be used to invoke configure with the same
parameters as were used by the last execution of *configure*.

**Note:** PHP must be configured with the switch --with-readline for phpdbg to support history, autocompletion, tab-listing etc.

ommand Line Options
====================

The following switches are implemented (just like cli SAPI):

 - -n ignore php ini
 - -c search for php ini in path
 - -z load zend extension
 - -d define php ini entry

The following switches change the default behaviour of phpdbg:

 - -v disables quietness
 - -s enabled stepping
 - -e sets execution context
 - -b boring - disables use of colour on the console
 - -I ignore .phpdbginit (default init file)
 - -i override .phpgdbinit location (implies -I)
 - -O set oplog output file
 - -q do not print banner on startup
 - -r jump straight to run
 - -E enable step through eval()
 - -l listen ports for remote mode
 - -a listen address for remote mode
 - -S override SAPI name

**Note:** Passing -rr will cause phpdbg to quit after execution, rather than returning to the console.
